A covered body lies on a bed. On a small table beside it rest a pair of Mammy’s earrings, glittering. Mary and Sarah stand looking at them, tense.]<br> MARY: (softly) God, Sarah… those earrings—are they really hers?<br> SARAH: (eyes wide) Mammy’s, by the holy water. I recognised the clasp. Didn’t wear them since she got those at Feeney’s fair.<br> MARY: (swaying) But… what are they doing here, at this… scene? I mean… I shouldn’t be saying this— but it looks bad.<br> SARAH: Bad? It’s awful, Mary. If anyone sees those earrings—people’ll talk. This is not just grief now, it’s trouble.<br> MARY: (pacing) We need to put them somewhere safe. Bury them with her? No, that’ll raise questions.<br> SARAH: Hide them! Lock 'em in your jewellery box, or under the floorboards. Anywhere!<br> MARY: (hesitates) I'd hate to lose them. She’d kill me if she thought I misplaced them. After everything.<br> SARAH: Mammy’s sense of ‘losing’—you wouldn’t live through it. She’d have the heavens and earth turned inside out.<br> MARY: (stops pacing) Maybe… maybe we leave them with Sister Michael? She has no reason to lie about things.<br> SARAH: And what if she does? Then those earrings—Mammy’s beloved earrings—end up in some official report.<br> MARY: (kneels, picks up earrings) I can’t— I can’t leave them here, with this… this body.<br> SARAH: Don’t touch them too much, they’ll tarnish. Mammy loved them shining.<br> MARY: (places earrings back on table) Right. We’ll come back for them. Once no one's here. Once it’s safe.<br> SARAH: Safe? In this house? With the rumours flying? With Granda Joe talking to the neighbours?<br> MARY: (firmly) It’s the only chance we’ve got. Trust me, Sarah. I’ll look after them. Them earrings are Mammy’s pride.<br>",,"[In the room with the dead body. Sarah and Mary stand over it.]<br> MARY: After all was said and done, she wasn't a bad oul soul. I was actually quite fond of her, you know. And I really hope she's up there now, looking down on us both, thinking What in under Christ?!<br> SARAH: Aye, me too, Mary.<br> MARY: No, Sarah. Look! The earrings. Look at the earrings!<br> SARAH: God, aye. I wouldn't have put a drop on her, now, she doesn't have enough neck. She'd have been better with a stud.<br> MARY: They're Mammy's. She's wearing Mammy's earrings!<br> SARAH: So they are! How did she get them?!<br> MARY: She probably swooped in like a vulture before Mammy drew her last breath. And now the oul bitch (turns to make sure no one's at the door) is getting buried in them! Has the woman no shame?!<br> SARAH: Earrings like that don't deserve to be buried alive! It's a sin!<br> MARY: She is doing this to spite us, you know.<br> SARAH: What should we do?<br> MARY: I don't know.<br> SARAH: (whispering) We could replace them with exact replicas.<br> MARY: Right.

I need to see her coffin. Say goodbye properly.<br> Orla: We’ll help you, Auntie Mary.<br> Erin: I’ll do the dishes and I’ll dust the stairs after. You rest a while.<br> Mary: Erin, you don’t have to—<br> Erin: I want to. It’ll give my mind something to do besides wondering.<br> Orla: I’ll dry.

It was just a very tragic<br> Granda Joe: My mother, she had the gift too, you know. By God, that woman could make her enemies drop like flies.<br> Mary: Well look, I don't have any gift.

What are you up to? What do you want?<br> Erin: Nothing. We just thought that we should pull our weight a bit more, Mammy.<br> Orla: You do so much for us, Aunt Mary.<br> Erin: And you deserve a bit of a break.<br> Mary: I can't hex people, girls. It was an accident!<br> (Gerry walks in.)<br> Gerry: So how's the wicked witch of the North West?<br> Granda Joe: Who put 50p in the eejit?<br> Mary: God, how am I going to go to this wake?<br> Granda Joe: It'll be grand, love. But listen, see if things do get heated? Try not to rise to it. The last thing we want is another dead body on our hands, here.<br> Mary: I'll do my best, Da.<br>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,

There's big Johnny Kells who works in Dunnes. Thick as fuck, but a massive, massive ride. Then there's this other fella, he's not as thick, but he's also not as hot, although I have heard he is really good with his hands.

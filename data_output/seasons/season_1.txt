SEASON 1
EPISODE 1

[In Erin's bedroom. Orla is reading Erin's diary.]

Erin: Is that my diary?

[In the Quinn kitchen. Erin is ranting to Mary while Orla casually licks her spoon.]

Erin: She's gone too far this time, Mammy. I mean, what next? Will I catch her trying on my knickers?

Mary: Don't say knickers in front of your father. He can't cope.

Erin: Aye, he can't cope.

Orla: Sure, what's a pair of knickers between cousins?

Mary: Less of the knickers.

Erin: I won't put up with it anymore. Teenagers have rights now, you know?

Mary: Don't be ridiculous.

Erin: They do, Ma. It's true. Sure, Macaulay Culkin might be divorcing his parents.

Mary: (to Jerry) Do you hear this? This'll be someone she met at that stupid summer scheme you insisted we send her on. A bloody 'Friends Across the Barricades' thing. I have nothing against Protestants. I'm all for integration, I am. But if they're letting their wains divorce them

Erin: Macaulay Culkin isn't a Protestant, Ma.

Mary: It's only gonna give our wains ideas.

Erin: Well, he might be. But I didn't meet him at 'Friends Across the Barricades'.

Mary: I don't care where you met him. You're not to see him again. Understood?

Erin: Fine. (storms off)

Granda Joe: (watching TV) Look at this. They're bombing the bridge, apparently.

Mary: (looks worried) No.

(Everyone runs to the TV)

Mary: Oh dear God, no. Does this mean they can't get to school? I've had a whole summer of it, Gerry. She's melting my head.

Gerry: Sure their bus can go the long way round.

(knock on the front door)

Mary: I'll get it. (opens door) Alright Sarah?

Granda Joe: (To Gerry) Them wains shouldn't have to take the bus to school. You should be driving them, you useless shit.

Gerry: I have to work, Joe.

Granda Joe: Work? (chuckles) Is that what you call it?

Gerry: Yes.

Granda Joe: Why don't you just leave my Mary alone?

Gerry: Because we've been married for seventeen years, Joe. We have two children. And because, we're in love with each other.
Erin: (looks disgusted while eating toast) Aw, boke.

Granda Joe: I'll find some dirt on you yet, boy. I've got people working on it.

Orla: (in shock while eating a bowl of cereal) God, Mammy. You're up early.

Sarah: So are you. You should be having a lie in, love. You're on your holidays. (takes bowl of cereal out of Orla's hands)

Mary: First day of term, Sarah.

Sarah: Is it, aye?

Mary: It is, aye.

(Erin takes large bite of toast while everyone starts watching the TV again.)
 
Sarah: (eating cereal) Well, I don't know about the rest of you, but I'm not enjoying this bomb.

Granda Joe: Shocking.

Mary: Desperate.

Sarah: Disgusting and disgraceful. I have an appointment at Tropicana at twelve. Fifteen minutes in this stand up. But sure I'll not get over the bridge at this rate. It's going to play havoc with my build-up. This is what they want. They want ordinary people to suffer. This is what it's all about.

Erin: I'm pretty sure interfering with your sunbed sessions isn't very high up on anyone's political agenda, Aunt Sarah.

Sarah: I wouldn't be so sure.

Erin: (gets up and puts on a denim jacket) We better head.

Mary: (looks shocked) Hey. What do you think you're playing at? Where's your blazer?

Erin: I've decided to put my own spin on the uniform this year.

Mary: I'll spin you across that floor. Get your blazer on.

Erin: Look, Mammy, I'm not a clone. I should be allowed to express my individuality. I'm sorry, I'm not wearing my blazer, end of story.

Mary: Gerry, pass me the wooden spoon.

(Erin looks appalled.)

[On the street. Clare is wearing a denim jacket, waiting for her friends. Erin and Orla approach wearing blazers.]

Clare: What's all this? I thought we were going to be individuals this year.

Erin: Look, I wanted to Clare, but my Ma wouldn't let me.

Clare: Well, I'm not being an individual on my own. (takes off jacket)

[In Dennis's Wee Shop. Erin, Orla and Clare are standing by the pick and mix. Clare smells some of the sweets.]

Erin: You not getting anything?

Clare: Sure, aren't I doing this fast for Ethiopia?

Erin: (putting sweets in bag and eating some) Oh for Christ's sake. What is it with you and Africa?

Clare: (excitedly) Will you sponsor me?

Erin: How much?

Clare: Two pound.

Erin: Two pound? Catch yourself on.

Clare: What's happening over there is really lousy, Erin. Father Conway showed us a video. There's this one wee fella, Kamal. He's only ten and every morning he walks twenty-five miles to the nearest well.

Orla: Does he just really enjoy wells, aye?

Erin: Twenty-five miles? How far is that?

Clare: Far.

Erin: Like, how far are we talking? From here to Buncrana?

Clare: Further. It's more like from here to Ballybofey.

Erin: Shut up. From here to Ballybofey? Sure you'd be knackered.

Clare: Kamal is knackered.

Erin: Are you sure Kamal isn't exaggerating?

Clare: Stop slagging off Kamal. Kamal doesn't have it easy. Now will you sponsor me or not?

Erin: Fine! (empties bag of pick and mix)

Dennis: Ah! (runs over to pick and mix) You touch them, you buy them. That's the law.

Erin: I don't think that is the law.

Dennis: (angry) If I say it's the law, it's the law, smart hole!

Erin: Right, it's just I can't afford them anymore. Have to give all my money to Kamal.

Dennis: Who the fuck's Kamal?

Orla: He's a wee Ethiopian fella from Ballybofey, Dennis.

(Erin looks embarrassed.)

Clare: (excitedly holds up flyer and pen) Do you want to sponsor me, Dennis?

Dennis: (furious) Get out!

(All three girls run out of shop.)

[Outside the shop. Erin, Orla and Clare stumble out. David Donnelly is putting up posters.]

Erin: Good one, Geldoff! (sees David) Oh my God. David. David Donnelly. Okay, just act normal. (laughs dramatically and starts walking) No way. Are you serious?

Clare: (concerned and confused) What are you doing? Who are you talking to?

David: Erin, have you got a light?

Erin: Me? No, I don't smoke. (whispers to self) Why the hell do I not smoke?

Orla: I have one. (throws lighter) I don't smoke either. I just like melting stuff.

(David looks confused.)

Erin: Cool poster.

David: Oh, do you think so? (lights cigarette)

Erin: Yeah. Really nice use of, you know, letters.

David: Thanks. You should come along tonight.

Erin: You're inviting me to your gig?

David: Yeah, well, all of you.

Erin: (smirks) But you'd specifically like me to go. I mean, just so we're clear.

(Erin stares deeply into David's eyes.)

Orla: But Erin, 'Murder She Wrote' is on tonight. You never miss 'Murder She Wrote'.

(Erin's expression changes into annoyance.)

Erin: (whispers) Shut up.

(Clare frantically runs up to Erin.)

Clare: We're going to be late.

David: Yeah. Kicks off at six.

Erin: Sweet. Cool. Maybe I'll see you there then.

(Clare drags Erin away quickly.)

(Orla stares at David, opening and closing her fists. David throws lighter and Orla catches it. She follows Erin and Clare.)

[At the bus stop. Erin, Clare and Orla pass a bus beside the river.]

(Orla follows with her arms in the air, pretending to be an aeroplane.)

Clare: (panicky) You're not seriously going to his concert, are you?

Erin: Gig, Clare. It's called a gig, and I have to go. He invited me specifically.

Michelle: (getting out of the bus that the girls just passed) Motherfuckers!

(Erin, Clare and Orla turn to face Michelle.)

Michelle: (walking towards the other girls) 'Motherfucker', it's my new thing. Watched this film last night. My Da got it off Pyro Pauline, and it's about these two lads, and they wear these crackin' suits and they rock about just shooting people and eating cheeseburgers, and they're all motherfucker this, motherfucker that. It's got your man in it. Awk, what do you call him? The disco dancer from 'Look Who's Talking'.

(James awkwardly and quietly stands behind Michelle.)

Erin: (staring at James awkwardly) Who owns the fella?

Michelle: (turns to look at James) Me. Well, come on then ball-ache. Are you introducing yourself, or what?

James: (nervously waves) Hi. I'm Michelle's cousin, James.

Orla: (quietly talks to Erin in a scared tone) Why's he making that funny noise?

Michelle: He's English, Orla. That's the way they talk. He's my Auntie Kathy's wain. I told you about my Auntie Kathy. She went to England years ago to have an abortion, never came back. (points at James) Never got the abortion either. Lucky for you, James, eh? Ha! (slaps James in the face)

(The girls walk towards the bus.)

James: (looks disconcerted) I didn't actually know that.

(James starts following the girls to the bus.)

Erin: What did he say?

Michelle: Nothing interesting.

Erin: What's he doing here?

Michelle: Kathy's just got divorced, so she's moved back. The husband caught her doing the dirt on him. She's a bit of a goer, is our Kathy. Riding rings around him, so she was. (turns to James) Isn't that right James?

(James looks uncomfortable and upset.)

Erin: No, I mean here, at our bus stop.

Michelle: Aw, he's going to our school.

Erin: But he's a fella. An effeminate fella, but a fella all the same.

Michelle: Everyone was shitting it about sending him to the boys' school. They were worried that the lads would beat him up because, well

All: He's English.

Michelle: And you couldn't really blame them, I suppose.

(James looks offended.)

Michelle: Our carriage awaits, motherfuckers.

(Everyone steps onto the bus.)

[On the bus. Michelle takes Avon catalogues out of her bag and hands them out to people as she walks towards the back of the bus.]

Michelle: Avon. Avon. Avon. We have a wee offer on there for hair removal cream, if you want to, with the (gestures towards random girl's moustache area)

Erin: There's no seats down here.

Michelle: Just move them wee dicks. (gestures towards first years sitting at the back of the bus)

Clare: (shocked) What?

Michelle: Why should we sit up the front? We're fifth years. They're foetuses. Come on. (drags Erin)

Michelle: (to first years) All right, shift your short holes. Let's go.

(Most first years get up from their seats.)

Tina: Nobody move.

Michelle: You better do as I say, or

Tina: Or what?

Michelle: Or there'll be consequences.

Tina: Such as?

Michelle: We'll, we'll beat you up.

(Erin looks horrified.)

Clare: (whispering) Wonderful.

Erin: Really, Michelle?

Tina: Go on, then.

Michelle: What?

Tina: Beat me up.

(Orla looks shocked.)

Michelle: Well, not now.

(Clare looks terrified.)

Michelle: After school. We'll beat you up after school.

Tina: Grand. I'll meet you after school, and you can beat me up.

Erin: What's happening, exactly?

Tina: I'll bring my sister, Mandy. You might know her. Mandy O'Connell. She's in upper sixth.

Erin: (looks scared) Big Mandy? Big Mandy's your sister?

Tina: That's right.

Erin: (whispers) Retreat.

Michelle: Listen, I think there's been a wee bit of a misunderstanding.

Tina: Thought you might say that. Now fuck off.

(All the girls turn away in a fluster.)

Michelle: Right. Will do.

Erin: Well, that wasn't at all humiliating.

[Time lapse.]

(Clare stares longingly at Orla eating food.)

Erin: How long does this fast last?

Clare: Twenty-four hours. So I still have (looks staggered) almost twenty three hours to go.

Michelle: Fuck me, not the Africans again.

Clare: Imagine being born there and not here. We don't know how lucky we are.

Michelle: Aye, fair dues. Derry is class.

Orla: It is, aye.

(The girls look relaxed and content. James looks anxious as he looks out the window.)

(Soldiers stop the bus and climb on with guns.)

Soldier: Everyone remain seated.

(Erin yawns. Soldier walks down the bus checking each row of seats.)

James: (looking panicked) What's going on?

Michelle: I dunno. But do you think if I told him I had an incendiary device down my knickers, he'd have a look?

Erin: Michelle. He's a soldier.

Michelle: Ach, some of them are rides. I'm willing to admit it, even if nobody else will, because I'm a beacon of truth, Erin.

Erin: You're a mouth, that's what you are.

[At Our Lady Immaculate College. Michelle, Erin, Clare, Orla and James are walking down the corridor. Jenny appears.]

Jenny: Hi guys!

(Everyone looks disinterested.)

Jenny: Could I just have a quick chat? (points at James) You must be new. (shakes James' hand) I'm Jenny. Great hair. Very bold. I'd love to go that short but sure, I don't have the bone structure.

Michelle: He's a fella, Jenny.

Jenny: Oh, I see. Anyhoo

Michelle: (mocking) Anyhoo. Seriously, shoot me in the face.

Jenny: This is a bit awkward, but part of my role as prefect is welcoming the first-year students. And it's come to my attention that there was some sort of an incident on the bus this morning.

Michelle: There was no incident.

(Clare looks anxious.)

Jenny: Apparently, you guys threatened one of the new girls. Said yous were gonna beat her up.

Michelle: That's lies.

Jenny: There were quite a few witnesses.

Michelle: No, I mean, we said it but as a joke. As in, We're gonna beat you up. But like, in a jokey way.

Jenny: Right. Well, the thing is, that's not actually funny, is it? Like, at all.

Clare: Well, humour is so subjective really, so

Jenny: Now, the wee girl claims that she's not bothered, but reading between the lines

Erin: Why are you reading between the lines?

Jenny: I'm just not so sure that I believe her. I don't want to report you guys.

Clare: (frantically) Please don't report us, Jenny. Please! We'll do anything. Anything at all.

Michelle: (pulls Clare back) Speak for yourself, sugar tits.

Jenny: Think I'll just have to mull it over.

(Clare looks terrified.)

Michelle: Ach Jenny, mull this over. (puts up middle finger)

Jenny: Oh, I see.

Clare: Jesus, Michelle!

(James looks overwhelmed.)

[In the assembly hall. Jenny is on stage.]

Jenny: A new school can seem like a very scary place.

Clare: (whispering) Do you think Big Mandy looks more schizo than usual?

(Clare and Erin turn to look at Big Mandy, who stares back.)

Jenny: But try to think of it this way. Right now, you're like a little seed, and the school is like the soil. A safe and stable environment, within which you can grow.

(Aisling pretends to water soil with a watering can, and pulls up a fake flower.)

Aisling: Wow, what a great way to look at it.

(Jenny smiles and nods arrogantly.)

Jenny: Thank you.

(All students stare at her blankly.)

Sister Michael: (walking up to microphone) Thank you girls. Some lovely sentiments there. Some very beautiful words. Unfortunately, that's all they are  sentiments and words. What you've just witnessed is a piece of fiction. The reality, I'm sorry to say, is much harsher. Far more brutal. So let me take this opportunity to advise all our new girls to keep their guard up. Watch their back. Oh, speaking of pupils who need to watch their back, I'd like to introduce James Maguire. Show yourself please, James.

(James anxiously raises his hand.)

Sister Michael: James will be the first ever boy to study here at Our Lady Immaculate College. He was due to start at Christian Brother Boys but there were concerns for his safety, because, unfortunately, James happens to be English.

(Everyone laughs.)

(James looks uncomfortable.)

Sister Michael: But let me make one thing clear. I will not have a repeat of the Mr. Mullin affair. Is that understood?

James: (whispering to Michelle) What's the Mr. Mullin affair?

Michelle: Student teacher. Two fourth-years cable-tied him to the monkey bars and started dry riding him. He was really good looking, so you've nothing to worry about.

Sister Michael: Let us pray. Father, Son

[By the lockers.]

Erin: Please, Michelle.

Michelle: No. I have no interest in David Donnelly's spazzmo band.

(Erin looks devastated.)

(Michelle eats food.)

Clare: (longingly) They look nice.

Erin: I can't go on my own.

Clare: Are they nice?

Michelle: Bring Bobby Sands. (points at Clare)

Clare: Sure, how could I go? I'm so weak I can barely walk.

Michelle: What about Orla?

Erin: Orla's

Orla: (staring lovingly at her fingers) I love my wee fingers.

Erin: Orla's mental. Come on Michelle! I'm begging you! It's my big chance with David. I'd do it for you.

Michelle: Fine.

(Erin's face lights up with excitement.)

Michelle: But we both know you're gonna sit in the corner like a frigid fuck.

Erin: (looks annoyed) I'm not frigid.

Orla: You've never even kissed a boy before. You practice on your pillow sometimes, but you don't think that's the same.

Erin: The reading of the diary was bad enough. I could do without the quoting it from memory!

James: Michelle, would you mind showing me where the toilet is?

Michelle: You are really starting to do my head in, do you know that?

Announcement: Will the following pupils please report to Sister Michael's office immediately. Erin Quinn, Orla McCool, Clare Devlin, Michelle Mallon, and the wee English fella. Thank you.

(Orla looks horrified. James looks confused.)

Michelle: Wonder what that could be about?

[Outside Sister Michael's office. The four girls sit.]

Erin: It wasn't bullying. It was attempted bullying.

Clare: What if we get expelled?

Michelle: Nobody ever actually gets expelled. Wanda Gallagher hasn't even been expelled, and she's in the IRA.

Erin: So that's probably why.

(James approaches.)

James: I can't find the boys' toilets anywhere.

Michelle: It's an all-girls school, dick face. There are no boys' toilets.

James: So should I just use the girls' toilets?

Michelle: No you should not, you fucking pervert.

Clare: (panicking) Girls, I really don't feel great. I feel sort of shaky. I think my blood sugar is dangerously low.

Erin: Seriously, will you just have a Mars bar?

Clare: What about Kamal?

Michelle: Fuck Kamal.
(Chair creaks from Sister Michael's office. Clare suddenly grabs the other girls.)

Clare: Look, whatever happens in there, we have to stick together, okay? We have to back each other up!

(Sister Michael opens the office door.)

Sister Michael: Ladies.

[Inside Sister Michael's office.]

Clare: So it had nothing to do with me! Yes, okay, I was there. I admit that, but I didn't do anything. It was Michelle. It was all Michelle. I'm not going down for something I didn't do. If anyone deserves to get punished, it should be Michelle.

(Everyone stares at Clare.)

Sister Michael: Well I think it's safe to say, we all just lost a bit of respect for you there, Clare.

(Clare looks embarrassed.)

Sister Michael: This is just so disappointing, girls. I mean, threatening a first year.

Michelle: We didn't threaten her. We're not stupid. Big Mandy is her sister and she's half fucking gorilla.

Sister Michael: That's quite enough, Miss Mallon.

Orla: Aye, you shouldn't swear Michelle, because when you swear, our Lady in heaven, she cries her tears and then make rain. Isn't that right, Sister Michael?

Sister Michael: What age are you now, Orla?

Orla: Fifteen.

Sister Michael: Yeah. You might want to think about wising up.

Erin: It was all just a misunderstanding. I promise, Sister.

Sister Michael: Is that right, Tina? Was it a misunderstanding?

Tina: Look, I didn't even report them. I'm not a grass. I'm saying nothing.

Sister Michael: Is that because you're intimidated by them?

(Tina scoffs)

(Sister Michael stares at her seriously.)

Tina: Oh, you're serious. No. I'm not intimidated by them, Sister.

Sister Michael: Okay. Well, I see no need to take this matter any further, but if I ever get wind of something like this happening again

Erin: Oh you won't, Sister.

(Clare vigorously shakes her head.)

(James raises his hand.)

Sister Michael: Yeah?

James: Sister Michael, can I just quickly ask, um, since there's no male student toilets on the premises, am I permitted to use the staff ones?

Sister Michael: Absolutely not. Now, I think you all owe Tina an apology, don't you?

(Tina pompously turns to face the group.)

All: We're very sorry, Tina.

Sister Michael: Now Tina, do you accept their apology?

Tina: No.

Sister Michael: You don't accept their apology?

Tina: Do I have to accept their apology, Sister?

Sister Michael: I don't suppose you do, no.

Tina: Then I don't. I don't accept it.

(Michelle, James, Orla, Erin and Clare stand awkwardly.)

Sister Michael: Well I need to draw a line under this somehow, so

[In the detention room. The group are sitting with Sister Declan at quarter past six in the evening.]

(The clock ticks.)

Erin: I cannot actually believe this. I'm missing David Donnelly's gig, Michelle.

Michelle: And all because of that miniature motherfucker.

Erin: (whispers) I swear, if you say 'motherfucker' one more time

Michelle: What's wrong with you?

Erin: This is your fault.

Michelle: Why is it my fault?

Erin: You're the one who threatened a first year. You're the one who gave Jenny Joyce the finger.

James: (looking anxious) I'm desperate now. This is agony.

Michelle: Can you please stop crying in my face for five fucking minutes, James?

Clare: I feel awful. I think my body's going into starvation mode. I think it's starting to shut down.

Michelle: For Christ's sake, Clare. You've just basically skipped lunch.

(Orla happily reads Erin's diary.)

Erin: Orla, that better not be what I think it is. You better not have brought my diary to school!

Orla: I had to. I'm doing my book report on it.

(Erin leaps out of her chair and tries to grab the diary from Orla. Orla holds on tight.)

Sister Declan: What's going on there, girls?

Erin: She has my diary, Sister, and she won't give it back.

Sister Declan: I'll take that.

(Erin crosses her arms angrily. Orla passes the diary to the nun.)

Sister Declan: Sit down.

(James raises his hand.)

Sister Declan: Mr. Maguire. You have been warned. Do not ask me again.

James: This is disgraceful. I should have access to a lavatory. What about my civil rights?

Sister Declan: Corner.

(James angrily stands in the corner. Michelle applies lipstick.)

Sister Declan: (to Michelle) Give that here.

Michelle: Ach, sister

Sister Declan: Now.

(Michelle passes her lipstick to Sister Declan. Sister Declan puts it in her handbag.)

Michelle: Shouldn't you put that in the confiscated box?

Sister Declan: Quiet.

(Sister Declan begins to read Erin's diary.)

Erin: Really?

Michelle: What am I going to do, Erin? That colour's been discontinued.

(Sister Declan eats sandwich. Clare stares desperately at the sandwich.)

Clare: This is torture.

James: (looking desperate) Michelle, I can't hold it in any longer.

Michelle: What part of me not giving a flying fuck are you struggling with, exactly?

(Sister Declan lies with her face in Erin's diary.)

Michelle: Oh, look. Your boring fucking diary sent her to sleep. I'm taking my lipstick back.

(Michelle gets up from her seat.)

Clare: Michelle, you can't do that. It's stealing.

Michelle: She stole it first.

Clare: Michelle, don't.

(Clare and Orla also get out of their seats and approach Sister Declan.)

James: Oh, God.

(James runs to the bin and urinates in it.)

Erin: Jesus that's disgusting. Stop it.

(Clare stuffs her face with Sister Declan's sandwich.)

Michelle: That's the English for you. Fucking savages.

(Clare looks guilty. Erin looks horrified.)

Clare: Don't look at me like that, Erin. You'll get your two pound back. (continues eating)

Michelle: But will you ever get your self-respect back, Clare?

(Erin gets up out of her seat.)

Erin: Right, if I leave now, I might still catch David.

Clare: (anxiously) What if Sister Declan wakes up?

(Erin begins climbing out the window. James continues urinating.)

Orla: (holding Sister Declan's head up) It's funny how she sleeps with her eyes wide open, isn't it?

Erin: (half-way out the window) What?!

(Sister Michael walks into the room. Orla, still holding the dead nun's head, turns to her in shock. Erin, still half-way out the window, James, still urinating, Clare, eating the sandwich, and Michelle, rummaging through Sister Declan's handbag also turn to her in shock.)

Sister Michael: Sweet suffering Jehovah.

(James groans and continues urinating. Everyone turns to face him awkwardly.)

[In Sister Michael's office.]

(Knock on door.)

Sister Michael: Enter.

(The parents walk in.)

Mary: Erin, what in God's name?

Gerry: Did you kill that wee nun, girls?

Erin: Of course we didn't.

Sarah: Then why were you pissing on her dead body and making sandwiches?

Granda Joe: Say nothing, girls. Say nothing til we've seen a lawyer.

Sister Michael: If you could all just take a seat.

(They sit down. Deidre storms in.)

Deidre: Sorry I'm late, Sister. Couldn't get over the bridge. This bloody bomb. I begged the Brits to let me take my chances, but the awkward bastards made me go the long way.

Granda Joe: Health and safety gone mad, Deidre.

Deidre: What are you playing at, rifling through a dead nun's handbag?

Michelle: She stole my lipstick, Mammy.

Deidre: Don't lie. Sister Declan was a woman of God.

Sister Michael: Actually, she was known to be a bit light fingered.

James: Where's my mum, Auntie Deidre?

Deidre: She's away back to London.

James: What, without me? (tears in his eyes)

Deidre: Oh, dry your eyes, James.

(Clare's dad walks in.)

Clare's dad: Sorry to keep you waiting, Sister. How long does it take to defuse a fecking bomb? Sure the wee robots do all the work. Oh killing nuns now, is it?

Clare: (frantically) I didn't, Daddy!

Clare's dad: You wait until your mother hears about this.

Sister Michael: Obviously, Sister Declan's death was extremely shocking and unexpected. We're still struggling to understand exactly what happened.

(Erin raises her hand.)

Sister Michael: Yeah?

Erin: Can I just ask, what age was Sister Declan?

Sister Michael: She'd have been ninety-eight on Friday.

Erin: Right. Might that shed some light on the situation?

Sister Michael: How so?

Erin: Does anybody else have any thoughts on the whole her being almost ninety-eight years of age thing?

Granda Joe: (sadly) Struck down in her prime.

(Erin looks confused.)

Sister Michael: The hospital are saying it was heart failure, but I have my doubts. As I said on the phone, the circumstances in which I found her body were strange, to say the least. So I've decided to carry out a full investigation into the incident.

Mary: (nodding) That makes sense.

(Sister Michael nods.)

Erin: What? Nothing about this makes sense? The woman was almost ninety-eight years of age. She had a heart attack. Why is everybody going absolutely mental?

Gerry: Less of the cheek, Erin.

(Clare looks distraught.)

Erin: We didn't do anything. It's not fair!

Orla: (Reading Erin's diary) But the thing is, life isn't fair. You see injustice is something I have become accustomed to. I am, after all, a child of the crossfire, surrounded by conflict. But I choose to rise above it. The path to peace is paved with tolerance and understanding. Violence is never the answer.

(Erin looks furious.)

Erin: I am going to ram that so far up your arse!

EPISODE 2

[In the assembly hall. Jenny Joyce and her friends are on stage.]

(Jenny is singing and dancing. Her friends are her backup singers.)

Jenny: (singing) I feel it in my fingers, I feel it in my toes. Love is all around me, and so the feeling grows.

(Clare looks disgusted. Orla dances along enthusiastically. Erin looks bored. James looks shocked. Michelle looks judgmental.)

Michelle: Sweet Jesus.

Jenny and friends: It's written in the wind. It's everywhere I go. So if you really love me, come on and let it show.

Sister Michael: Did I not ban this one?

Woman: Let me see. Uh 'Endless Love', 'The Power of Love', 'All You Need is Love', 'How Deep is Your Love', 'It Must Have Been Love', 'I Wanna Know What Love is', 'I Will Always Love You'. No, Sister, you didn't.

Jenny: There'll be no end. Cause on my love you can depend. (dramatically sings out of key)

(Orla holds up lighter enthusiastically.)

Sister Michael: (looking uncomfortable) Put it on the list. (stands up) Uh, wonderful, girls. Lovely stuff.

(Orla claps enthusiastically. Everyone else looks bored.)

Sister Michael: Before I dismiss you for the weekend, a few announcements.

(Michelle looks impatient.)

Sister Michael: On Monday morning, several of our year thirteens will face their GCSE maths resit. Now, I know how daunting resit examinations can be, so if anyone is feeling anxious or worried, or even if you just want to chat, please, please, do not come crying to me. Let me see. What else?

Michelle: Come on, come on, come on, to fuck!

Sister Michael: Notice from Mr. Macaulay. This year's destination for the Euro Trotters trip will be, dramatic pause

(Everyone waits expectantly.)

Sister Michael: Did you actually want me to do the dramatic pause? Interesting. Ah, Paris. It's going to be Paris.

(Clare gasps. Erin smiles dramatically and looks out into space.)

Sister Michael: If you need any further information, there is a stall in the foyer.

(Michelle smiles excitedly.)

Sister Michael: Sadly, I am unable to come on this one, as I despise the French. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.

[In the corridor. Erin, Clare, Orla, Michelle and James walk through a door.]

Clare: There's so much I want to do. The Champs-lyses, the Arc de Triomphe, the Louvre.

Michelle: A French fella. That's what I want to do. Nation of rides. My fanny's going funny just thinking about it!

(Orla sucks on a large dummy sweet.)

Erin: Could you not use that word, Michelle?

Michelle: What, fanny?

Clare: Why do you always have to be so coarse?

Michelle: Ach, what's the big deal? We all have one.

James: I don't.

Michelle: You are one.

Erin: Of course, Beckett lived in Paris, and if anybody's influenced my writing, it is

Michelle: What, Brenda Beckett from 12A?

Erin: No! Not Brenda Beckett. Beckett Beckett.

Orla: If we go to Paris, I'd like to meet Nicole. (stares at dummy sweet and licks it)

James: Who's Nicole?

Erin: For God's sake. How many times? It's just an ad. She's not a real person. Neither is Papa.

James: Be good conversation practice as well, you know, for the orals.

(Clare nods excitedly.)

Michelle: Which will be the only oral that you

James: Yeah okay, Michelle!

Michelle: You didn't let me finish.

James: Well, I sensed where you were going.

Michelle: (to Clare) Blowjobs.

(Clare scoffs disgustedly.)

Erin: Oh God. Don't tell me Charlene Kavanagh is going. She is dying about herself. Oh I'm so good looking, oh I'm so popular. If there ever was a more shallow, self-absorbed, generally unpleasant human being

Charlene: Hi, Erin.

Erin: (flustered) Hi. Good, grand. Not too bad. Can't complain. Is the answer I'd have given if you'd asked how I was.

Charlene: Right. Are you signing up for Paris? I can't convince that lot to come. Looks like I'm going to need someone to hang out with.

Erin: It would be an honour.

Charlene: Okay. Well, I'll see you later, then. (walks away)

Erin: You will, Charlene. Indeed you will!

(Clare waves.)

Erin: (turning to friends) Did you hear that? The Charlene Kavanagh wants to hang out with little old me!

Clare: You know what I admire most about you, Erin? Your unshakeable principles.

(They approach the stall for the Paris trip.)

Jenny: Bonjour. Tout le monde. Comment allez-vous?

Michelle: Wise up, Jenny.

Erin: Where do we sign?

Michelle: (looking at paper) Hold on. Stall the fucking ball. Three hundred and seventy-five quid? Are you for real?

(Orla stares at French flag. Clare looks horrified.)

Erin: What? 375 pound each? Isn't there some sort of group discount?

Jenny: It's not Club eighteen to thirty.

Michelle: More's the pity.

Clare: It is a bit steep, Jenny.

Jenny: Just dip into your trust fund. I do it all the time.

Erin: Our what?

(Orla waves the French flag.)

Jenny: It's like an account your parents set up for you to help pay for things, like University, your first car, educational trips.

Erin: I did not know about this. (to Michelle) Did you know about this?

Michelle: No, did I fuck.

Erin: Trust fund, you say. Interesting.

(Clare looks excited.)

[In the Quinn kitchen.]

(Mary is carrying a laundry basket.)

Mary: Dip into your trust fund? Of course, no bother at all. Pass us in the phone. I just need to ring the bank. Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. That's the account number. And the password, what was it again? What is it now? Oh aye. Catch yourself on!

(Granda Joe is watching TV with the baby.)

Mary: Da, for God's sake. Will you turn that down?

Granda Joe: I have turned it down. It's at zero.

Ian Paisley on TV: have an opportunity there!

Granda Joe: I don't know how he does it.

Erin: (to Mary) Are you telling me I don't have a trust fund?

Mary: There you go, you're not as slow as you look.

(Orla looks desperately at Mary.)

Orla: Do I have a trust fund, Mary?

Mary: Listen girls, there are no trust funds! There are no funds, period.

Erin: (leaping onto chair) For God's sake!

(Gerry is writing at the kitchen table. Orla looks over his shoulder.)

Gerry: Okay. That's one portion of red fish, one portion of white fish, two bags of chips.

Granda Joe: No, no, no, no. Two bags won't be enough.

(Joe stands and walks towards table.)

Gerry: Two's plenty, Joe.

Granda Joe: (carrying baby) Four. Four should cover it.

Gerry: Three, then. We'll compromise.

Granda Joe: I'll compromise you through that window.

Mary: That's enough, Da.

Granda Joe: The tight bastard's trying to starve us all, Mary.

Gerry: Okay. Four bags of chips then.

Orla: And I want twelve chicken nuggets, a small battered hotdog, plenty of onions, plenty of

Erin: Get a move on, Daddy. At that chippy, it's every man for himself on a Friday night.

Gerry: I am trying to concentrate here, Erin!

(Sarah walks in.)

Orla: All right, Mammy?

Sarah: All right, love. Did you ask about the trust fund?

(Mary sorts through laundry.)

Orla: Aye, I don't have one.

Sarah: I take it that means I don't have one.

Mary: For the love of God. (walks away)

Sarah: Will four bags be enough?

Gerry: More than enough!

Sarah: I say we need five, to be safe. Do you not think, Da?

Granda Joe: Stick down five.

Gerry: (sighs in frustration) Five bags of chips, then!

Granda Joe: I'll have a chicken fillet burger. No lettuce, no tomato, no cheese.

Gerry: I'll just write plain, will I?

Granda Joe: No onions, no cucumber.

Gerry: One plain-

Granda Joe: No relish, no pickles, no mayonnaise.

Gerry: No chicken.

Granda Joe: What do you mean, no chicken?

(Phone rings. Orla looks startled.)

Mary: Get that.

(Erin sighs impatiently, and walks towards phone.)

Granda Joe: It's a chicken burger. Of course I want chicken! What are you, a simpleton?

Erin: Hello?

Granda Joe: No chicken!

(Erin runs over with phone.)

Erin: It's Uncle Colm.

Mary: Well, I'm not taking it. I've been stung once already this week. An hour and forty-five minutes talking about his new shoelaces.

Sarah: Sure I've stopped answering my phone altogether for fear it's him, Mary.

Mary: Will you take it, Da?

Granda Joe: No chance, love. I mean I know I shouldn't say this about my own brother, but by Christ, he's a boring bastard.

Erin: Is somebody going to take it or not?

Mary: Don't you be cheeky!

Gerry: Less of the cheek, you.

(Mary grabs phone from Erin.)

Mary: How's it going, Colm?

(Granda Joe sits down in front of the TV again.)

Sarah: Would you ever think of going cordless?

Mary: (on phone) Aye, it was freezing cold earlier, that's true.

Sarah: Gemma Sharkey went cordless, and she's like a new woman now, Gerry.

Mary: (on phone) Naw, it's not as cold now.

Sarah: She can make a call from her living room, from her kitchen, from her bedroom

Mary: (on phone) Right, look, Colm, I don't have long. We're sending to the chippy here. (impatiently turns to look at family)

Sarah: And the other night, right, and this is no word of a lie, she rang me from the bath. These cordless phones are the future.

Mary: (on phone) What?

(Granda Joe turns interestedly.)

Mary: (on phone) Oh my God!

(Mary lowers phone, looking shocked.)

Gerry: What's up?

Mary: Our Colm's in the police station. Last night two gunmen forced their way into his house, tied him up, stole his van.

Granda Joe: (now standing again) Dirty bastards.

Mary: (on phone) Oh, God love you, you poor critter. You're to come straight round here, you hear me? Oh of course, of course. (puts down phone)

(Everyone looks shocked and concerned.)

Gerry: Is he all right?

Mary: He is traumatized, Gerry. He'll take a steak and kidney pie.

(Gerry writes down Uncle Colm's order while Erin, Orla and Mary watch.)

Mary: Do you think five bags will be enough?

(Gerry looks frustrated.)

[In the chippy. Chips are thrown into the frier.]

Erin: (reading from paper) Seven bags of chips. Twelve chicken nuggets. One small battered hotdog. One plain chicken burger.

(Orla nods along with order.)

Fionnula: Give me that. Move. (grabs list)

Erin: Thank you, Fionnula.

(Clare walks in.)

Erin: All right? Any joy with the trust fund?

Clare: Nah. According to my Ma we're actually quite poor.

Erin: Aye, I think we might be as well.

Fionnula: (to Clare) What's yours?

Clare: (flustered) Uh (stammering) Can I please get one fish supper and one cowboy special, please Fionnula, thank you please.

Fionnula: It'll be ready when it's ready.

(Michelle and James walk in.)

Michelle: Well, Jenny Joyce was talking through her fat hole about this trust fund thing.

Fionnula: (to Michelle) What's yours?

Michelle: Don't rush me, Fionnula!

(Fionnula looks annoyed.)

Michelle: Where the fuck are we going to get the money for Paris now?

Orla: We could sell our organs.

Clare: We could. We could sell our organs. Or, and forgive me if this is a bit left field, but could we not, you know, get jobs?

Michelle: There are no jobs in Derry. That's all you ever hear anybody say.

Clare: So what are these? (walks over to notice board)

Michelle: I never really looked at this before. I just assumed they were all dead cat posters.

Clare: Missing cat posters.

Michelle: If you're an optimist.

(They all stare at the notice board. Orla has her hands on Erin's shoulders.)

Erin: I'm not sure I'd be suited to any of these. They're all very practical, and I'm just more creative.

Michelle: You're more of a slabber.

(Random girl pulls contact details off flyer on notice board. Michelle looks at her worryingly.)

Michelle: Fucks sake. I think other people are onto this thing, girls.

Fionnula: (to Michelle) Oy! I'll not ask you again!

Michelle: A large curry butty, Fionnula. And don't be shy with the salt now.

Fionnula: (gesturing to James) What about the wee limey?

Michelle: Well, dicko?

(James looks anxious.)

James: (turning to Fionnula) I'm okay, thanks.

(Everyone turns to James in shock.)

Michelle: What?

James: I don't really want anything.

Erin: You don't want anything?

Michelle: How could you not want anything, it's lovely.

James: I just don't really fancy it, that's all.

(They all look horrified.)

Orla: I don't understand.

Clare: Are you not feeling well, James?

James: (shouting to everyone in chippy) I don't like it, okay?! It's too greasy! It's much, much too greasy! Even the smell of it makes me feel physically sick!

(Fionnula looks angry.)

Michelle: I'm sorry that you had to hear that, Fionnula. (to James) You're a fucking embarrassment.

(James looks regretful.)

Fionnula: Get him out of here.

Michelle: You heard the woman. (shakes her head)

(James looks sad as he walks out of the chippy.)

[In the Quinn kitchen. Uncle Colm has arrived.]

(Erin looks bored.)

Uncle Colm: There was a knock at the door. This must have been, ah, we're talking eight, half eight, for I was halfway through me dinner.

(Mary, Gerry, Joe and Erin look bored. Orla and Sarah look engrossed.)

Uncle Colm: And up I got to open it. And there they both were, large as life. And the taller fella, though to be fair, there was no more than an inch in it.

Mary: Jesus wept.

Uncle Colm: The slightly taller fella, he says to me, says he, do you know who we are?

(Orla still looks engrossed.)

Granda Joe: How's a body supposed to enjoy his dinner?

Uncle Colm: And I says to him, says I, well I can't be sure now, but maybe if you took off the balaclavas. And then he says to me, the slightly taller fella does, he says, step aside, we're armed.

Orla: Class.

Uncle Colm: And that's when the smaller fella, although as I say, we're talking an inch.

Erin: (whispering) Mammy, make it stop.

Uncle Colm: An inch and a half at most.

Sarah: I need a drink.

Uncle Colm: He has the bright idea of tying me to the radiator, you see. And I remember saying to myself, says I, Colm, it's a good job you have the Economy 7 on the oul timer, or you'd be roasted here.

Sarah: Did you go for the Economy 7 in the end, Colm? I thought you says the hot water settings were a minefield.

Gerry: For the love of God, Sarah, no diversions, please.

Mary: Aye, come on, let's pick it up. They tied you to the heater.

Uncle Colm: They did indeed. And there I am, shackled to the thermostatic valve with me new shoelaces, when one of them, the smaller fella, or hang on, maybe it was the

Gerry: Doesn't matter, Colm.

Uncle Colm: Well, it was one of the two. He's looking for the keys to the van. All ranting and raving and getting himself all worked up.

(Erin looks miserable.)

Uncle Colm: Threatening to set fire to my good chaise longue and all sorts. By Jesus, they were absolutely desperate to borrow thon van.

Mary: Colm, they didn't borrow your van. They stole your van, used it to move arms across the border, and then they blew it up.

Uncle Colm: Aye. Nightmare altogether.

Erin: Or diabolique, as they say in France.

Mary: Or, you're still not going to Paris, as they say in Derry.

Sarah: Ach, well, I'm delighted for you Colm.

Gerry: (confused) What?

Sarah: Well, I just mean that, well, before, he had nothing really going for him, but now, well, now he is somebody. Now he's the fella that got tied to his own radiator.

Uncle Colm: Thanks Sarah.

Sarah: We should ring UTV, get them to do an interview. When Shauna Sharkey was interviewed, do you mind the time where her and her brother got hijacked, well, Fionnula gave her free chips for a month.

Mary: (shocked) You're joking.

Sarah: Honest to God.

(Doorbell rings. Erin immediately jumps up.)

Erin: I'll go.

[Outside the Quinn house. James, Michelle and Clare stand, as Erin opens the door.]

Clare: (furious) You will never guess what she's done this time, Erin.

Erin: Did she nick the noticeboard from the chip shop, Clare?

(Michelle holds the noticeboard. Clare looks furious as Michelle looks impressed with herself.)

[By the river. The group stands with the noticeboard.]

Michelle: Fionnula was out the back, cashing up. I sneaked in, yanked it off the wall, and away I went. I was like a thief in the night.

Clare: (scoffing) You weren't like a thief in the night. You actually were a thief in the night. And you stole from Fionnula of all people. Fionnula! I once saw her punch a Rottweiler, Michelle! If she finds out about this, she'll kill you!

Michelle: Kill us. You're an accessory after the fact now, my friend.

Clare: (looking like she's going to cry) God!

Erin: Can I ask why you stole the noticeboard?

Michelle: So we get first dibs on all the jobs.

James: Wouldn't it have been easier to just remove the notices? They're only blu tacked on.

Michelle: (defeated) Fuck off, dickweed.

Erin: Christ, what possessed you Michelle?

Michelle: Yeah The more I talk about it, and the more I sober up, the less sure I am, really.

Clare: You were drunk?!

Erin: Brilliant!

Michelle: Look, we're not like Jenny Joyce. Nobody's just gonna hand us things. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't have things. Come on, Clare. (approaches Clare) I know how much you've dreamed of seeing the Arc de whatever the fuck it's called. (turns to James) James, I know how much you want to practice the shit out of the past participle. (turns to Orla and puts arm around her) Orla, you really, really buzz off those Renault Clio ads.

(Orla nods happily.)

Michelle: (walks over to Erin) And you, Erin. Well, you're just riding Charlene Kavanagh.

Erin: I'm not riding her. I just think it might be time I moved on, friendship-wise.

Clare: (furious) You are aware you're talking to your current friends?

(Michelle runs up onto the bridge.)

Michelle: We can't give up on Paris. Let's do this, girls. Let's just make it happen!

Erin: God, I've never seen you so fired up.

(They all look motivated and excited.)

Michelle: I will buck a French lad, Erin. I will buck a French lad, so help me God!

(Orla throws her arms in the air excitedly.)

[In Erin's bedroom. Erin stands in front of noticeboard while Clare, Orla, James and Michelle sit and watch her.]

Erin: (holding a notebook and pen) So, firstly we have the tutoring, and out of everyone, I thought you might be best suited to that, Clare, because

Clare: I'm the brightest.

Erin: Well, in that conventional sort of way, I suppose.

(Clare looks angry and offended.)

Erin: There is also some babysitting. The child will be in bed, so you should just about be able to manage that, Michelle.

Michelle: (sarcastically) Oh thanks! And you should just about be able to manage this. (gives finger)

Erin: (appalled) Always the lady. There's also some gardening, mowing the lawn, et cetera. This will require a bit of muscle, so

(James smiles.)

Erin: You should take that one, Orla.

James: (offended) No. I should do that one. It's a man's job, Erin. I'm a man.

Michelle: That's debatable.

James: Well, I'm more of a man than Orla.

Orla: (offended and appalled) I do not accept that.

James: Come on Erin.

(Erin rolls her eyes.)

Erin: Fine.

(James smiles.)

Erin: So that leaves dog-walking and washing a car.

Orla: Is it a Renault Clio?

Erin: No.

Orla: I'll take the dogs.

Erin: (smiles) Okay. Let's go to work.

(Everyone looks motivated and ready.)

(They all dramatically walk down the Quinn stairs and out the front door.)

[On the street. They walk in slow motion, confident. Van drives up beside them.]

Fionnula: You thieving wee fuckers! (she drives away)

(Everyone looks shocked and worried.)

[In the Quinn living room. Erin, Michelle, Orla, Clare, James and Fionnula sit. Mary stands.]

Michelle: (to Fionnula) How did you find out?

Clare: Doesn't matter how she found out, Michelle. That's not what's important. What's important is the fact that we are all deeply-
Fionnula: (pointing at Clare) Her mother rang me.

Erin: (shouting) You told your ma?!

(Erin and Michelle look disgusted.)

Clare: Okay. I cracked. I couldn't handle it, and I cracked.

Michelle: For fucks sake, Clare.

Mary: Enough! (to Fionnula) Where do we go from here?

Fionnula: Mary, look. You're family. Well, you're good people. Well, you're decent people. But I have to set an example.

Mary: No. Dear God, no. You're not talking about a ban.

James: (happily whispers) Yes!

(Everyone else looks distraught.)

Fionnula: Let's call it a suspension. I'm sorry, Mary.

(Sarah walks in.)

Sarah: Ach, Fionnula. What about you? I thought I could smell vinegar. I'm just on my way to meet our Colm here. I'm a nervous wreck. We're doing this interview you see, for UTV. I'm going to be on UTV, Fionnula.

Mary: Save your breath, Sarah. There'll be no free chips. (angrily) There'll be no chips, full stop.

Sarah: Excuse me?

Mary: What do you expect me to do on a Friday, Fionnula? Cook? You expect me to cook?

Fionnula: (shrugs) You could order a pizza.

Orla: (shakes her head) Pizza is not as nice.

Mary: No. You are right, Orla. Pizza is not as nice. Maybe you should have all thought about that.

(The kids look guilty.)

Mary: (looking upset) Is there nothing we can do?

(Fionnula looks thoughtful.)

[At the chippy. It is closed. Michelle, Clare, James, Erin and Orla are inside wearing aprons.]

Michelle: So, not only are we not going to Paris, we're spending our Sunday scrubbing Fionnula's fucking fish hole for free.

Erin: Aye, and she'll be back from yoga soon, so get a shift on.

Michelle: It's slave labour, Erin.

Orla: It's worse than slave labour. We're not even getting paid.

Erin: Look, Mammy had to cut some sort of deal.

James: Would living without fried food really be so bad?

(They all look offended.)

All: Yes!

(James looks taken aback.)

Michelle: She wouldn't actually have banned us. She was bluffing.

Clare: She's not bluffing, Michelle. Didn't she ban the McGuigan twins?

Michelle: Seriously?

Orla: Sure that's how they lost all the weight.

Michelle: (defeated) Right, girls. No dicking about. (stands on counter) We need to get this place fucking spotless. (puts on apron)

[Compilation of them cleaning unsuccessfully.]

(Michelle lights cigarette.)

Michelle: Fuck this. (walks away)

(Orla sprays bleach on her neck like perfume.)

Erin: (shocked) It's still sticky. How? How is it still sticky? Is it worse than when we started?

Clare: (looking around) I think it might be, yeah.

Erin: (furious) Great.

(Clare looks scared.)

James: Oh I see. (holding mayonnaise) Yeah. This isn't Windolene. This is (sniffs) This is mayonnaise.

Erin: (sarcastically) Great work, folks. Absolutely brilliant. Well done, everyone! It's been a productive morning! (kicks rubbish) Fionnula will be absolutely thrilled!

(Music blares from upstairs. They stop in shock.)

(Erin, Clare, Orla and James walk upstairs.)

[In Fionnula's living room. Michelle is dancing and drinking alcohol.]

(Orla looks excited and immediately starts dancing.)

(Erin angrily turns off the music.)

Michelle: Boo!

Clare: (terrified) Where'd you get all this? (gesturing towards multiple bottles of alcohol sitting on the table)

Michelle: Fionnula's cupboard. I think she might have a bit of a problem!

Erin: You think Fionnula might have a bit of a problem? (furious) Put it away and get back downstairs now!

(Michelle pours another drink.)

Michelle: Ach sit yourselves down, have a wee drink!

Clare: No, Michelle! It's wrong!

Michelle: So are those ski pants Clare, but that didn't stop you pulling them over your hole this morning.

(Clare looks down at her ski pants, offended.)

Michelle: Wait for it.

(Michelle lights the shots of alcohol on fire.)

Clare: Michelle!

(Orla looks amazed.)

Michelle: Don't be such a shower of bore bags!

(Clare looks terrified as Michelle picks up the tray of shots.)

Michelle: Slinte, motherfuckers.

(Everyone looks anxious. The tray wobbles.)

Erin: No, no, no, no, no!

Michelle: Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

(Michelle drops the tray and the rug lights up in flames.)

(Clare gasps.)

(The flames spread to the curtains as Michelle looks worried. She throws alcohol over the flames in an attempt to put out the fire.)

Erin: Are you throwing alcohol on it? Are you actually throwing alcohol on it?

(Clare squeezes sauce over the flames.)

Erin: And what in under God are you doing? Seasoning it?!

(Orla blows on the flames.)

(James runs over with fire extinguisher and sprays it on the flames.)

James: Wow.

(Clare coughs.)

Michelle: On a scale of one to ten, how dead do you think we are?

(Erin and Clare look angrily at Michelle, as Michelle looks guilty.)

[Time lapse. The TV is on and Mary and Sarah have arrived.]

Uncle Colm: The taller fella, well, it was one of the two.

(Mary looks furious.)

Uncle Colm: Anyway, he says to me, says he

(Orla, Michelle, Clare, James and Erin all sit on the sofa.)

Erin: It's the truth, Mammy.

Mary: Erin, if you expect me to believe that Michelle tripped while carrying a scented candle, you must think I came up the Foyle in a bubble.

(Sarah is watching herself on TV.)

Sarah: It's my bit! It's my bit!

Mary: What are we gonna do?

Sarah: Oh, for God's sake, Mary, would you look? You're missing my big moment.

Sarah: Two gunmen of roughly the same height, kicked his door down and tied him to the radiator with his own shoelaces. He barely had those shoelaces a week, John. They threatened him with physical violence. They threatened to burn his house down before manhandling

(Mary has an idea.)

(Erin reads her mother's expression with worry and curiosity.)

[Time lapse.]

(Mary and Sarah are tying the kids to the radiator with their shoelaces.)

Erin: Why would two gunmen break into a chippy?

James: (annoyed at Sarah) Ah! That really hurt!

Michelle: You're such a pussy.

Erin: What were they looking for?

Orla: Chips, obviously.

(Clare looks tortured.)

Mary: They were looking for the keys to the van. Keep up, Erin. (clicks her fingers in Erin's face)

Sarah: Do you think we should knock them about a bit?

(Orla nods her head in agreement.)

Mary: No!

Sarah: Nothing drastic. Just a few slaps.

(Erin looks worried.)

Mary: I said no, Sarah.

Sarah: What, not even the wee gay fella?

James: I'm not gay.

Mary: (finishes tying the kids to the radiators) Okay. That should do it. Ready?

(Sarah nods.)

Clare: (panicking) I hate to be a health and safety stickler, but surely you're not actually planning on leaving us like this, are you?

(Door slams. Footsteps.)

(Sarah and Mary look at each other in shock.)

Mary: (whispering) Back door? Back door. Back door. Hurry up.

(Mary and Sarah quickly leave the room. The kids look anxious.)

(Fionnula walks in with her yoga mat, in shock.)

Mary: (from outside the room) Push it! Push it! Push it!

Sarah: (from outside the room) I'm pushing! I'm pushing it!

Mary: (from outside the room) Pull it! Pull it!

Sarah: (from outside the room) It's locked!

(Everyone looks worried.)

(Fionnula looks angry as Mary and Sarah walk back into the room.)

Fionnula: What the fuck's going on here, exactly?!

Mary: Okay. Um, all right. Well, what happened was (points at Michelle) Michelle was carrying this scented candle.

(Fionnula looks at her questioningly.)

[In the Quinn kitchen. The family are eating pizza.]

Granda Joe: It's just not as nice. (throws pizza)


EPISODE 3

[In Erin's bedroom. Erin, James, Michelle, Orla and Clare sit.]

Erin: (staring at photo of Granda Joe and Toto sadly) I just can't get my head around it. The fact that he's gone forever.

Clare: (studying and drinking energy drink) It's so sad, it really is. It is so, so sad. But at the same time, what's done is done, so let's crack on. (gestures towards her study notes)

Erin: (distraught) Well, I'm sorry, Clare. Has his sudden, tragic death interrupted your studies?

Clare: (takes sip of energy drink) It has a bit, actually, yeah.

Erin: (staring at photo) How can you be so heartless?

Orla: Don't cry, Erin. He's in a better place now. Unless he's not, you know, because unless he's gone to hell. (points upwards)

(Erin looks appalled.)

Michelle: Can be please talk about something else? I'm half torn. This is wrecking my head.

Erin: What? Have you been drinking?

Michelle: Yes I have. And for future reference, if any of you invite me to a study sleepover again, and I'm desperate enough to accept that invitation, there's a good chance I have a litre bottle of Pernod in my bag. (screws lid off bottle)

Erin: I shouldn't even have to sit the exam, on, you know, compassionate grounds.

(Michelle takes drink from bottle.)

Clare: He was a dog, Erin! (throws can)

Erin: (looking upset) Toto was much more than a dog. Toto was my best friend. (holds photograph up for all to see)

Michelle: Christ, I feel a bit bokey. (gets up)

(Clare wipes her face and continues drinking another energy drink while studying.)

(Michelle pulls the curtains. Light streams in.)

Clare: (frantic) Sweet suffering Jesus! It's the morning already?! What are we going to do?!

Michelle: Maybe we could start with calming the fuck down.

Clare: Calm down? We're still on William of Orange, Michelle! We haven't so much looked at the famine!

Michelle: We've got the gist. They ran out of spuds. Everyone was raging.

(Orla looks satisfied with Michelle's explanation.)

James: Well, I can't tell my rebellions from my risings.

Michelle: And whose fault is that? If your lot had stopped invading us for five fucking minutes, there'd be a lot less to wade through, you English prick.

(James looks upset.)

Clare: (panting) Nothing's going in! Nothing is going in, and every time I try to make notes, it

(Clare stares, horrified, at her shaking hand.)

Clare: (whispering) What's happening to me?

James: There's quite a lot of caffeine in those, Clare. How many of them have you had?

Clare: (staring at her can) I don't know. Five? Twenty-three?

(She throws her empty can into a large pile of other empty cans.)

Michelle: (laughs) We are all so fucked.

[In the Quinn kitchen. The kids are eating breakfast.]

Granda Joe: Now, more bacon anyone? Another sausage? Wee omelette maybe? Anything at all? It's absolutely no bother.

(Clare is drinking another energy drink.)

Gerry: (reading newspaper) I'll have a cup of tea, Joe.

Granda Joe: Make your own tea.

Gerry: (taken aback) Yeah, I'll do that.

(James walks in, putting on his tie. Granda Joe looks concerned.)

Granda Joe: You stay over too, son?

James: Yes, I did. That's correct, sir.

Granda Joe: (looking at Erin) What? In your room?

(Erin is eating toast, looking worried.)

Granda Joe: Have you nothing to say about this, you slack southern shite?

(Gerry looks worried.)

Granda Joe: Look, I know the fella's gay

James: I'm not gay.

Granda Joe: But gay or not

James: Who said I was gay?

Granda Joe: He's still a fella. (staring at James) There's still a good chance that he's a rapist. I mean no offense, son.

(James looks scared.)

(Door opens and closes. Mary walks in with a spade.)

Mary: Well, that's that done.

Granda Joe: God rest his wee soul.

Sarah: Ach don't talk to me. I was in bits last night. Didn't even manage my Chinese. Poor Tonto.

Erin: (offended) Toto. His name was Toto, Aunt Sarah.

Sarah: (smoking) Aye, nightmare so it is. Da, do us a bacon butty, would you? My stomach thinks my throat's cut here.

Granda Joe: Surely, love.

Gerry: Jesus, the pets are getting it left, right and centre at the minute. Maureen Melarkey's Tigger passed away.

(Granda Joe slams the frying pan.)

Granda Joe: We do not utter that woman's name in this house.

Mary: (drinking a cup of tea) Ach, Da, not the bingo thing still.

Granda Joe: She's a cheating oul bitch.

Erin: How can you cheat at bingo, Granda?

Granda Joe: Her nephew brought her this pen back from New Jersey. It changes the numbers. I'm telling you, it's witchcraft, Mary.

Mary: We'll hear no more about the magic pen. Now come on, girls, eat up. You'll need all your energy for the big exam.

Clare: (frantically) We'll need a miracle for the big exam. (drinks energy drink)

Erin: Mummy, what happened to Toto, it's just hit me so hard and I'm worried, it might affect my performance.

Mary: Ach, come here, love.

(Erin looks accomplished. She gets out of her chair and walks over to Mary.)

Mary: Look, if you fail the exam, I promise you, there'll be a nice wee plot out there with your name on it.

(Orla looks entertained.)

[On the street. The kids walk up a hill.]

Erin: It's abuse. That's what it is, it's abusive. Does anybody have 10p? I'm ringing Childline.

Michelle: You can't ring Childline every time your ma threatens to kill you, Erin.

Clare: Yeah, you can't waste Esther's time like that.

Michelle: And anyway, you're not alone. We're all going to fail. We're all going to get our holes kicked and we're all in the same boat.

Clare: (shouting) I don't want to be in that boat! (spills energy drink) I want to be in a different boat, sailing down a totally different river.

(Orla walks away from the splashes of energy drink.)

James: Guys, all we can do is try our best.

Michelle: Ach, don't be such a fruit, James.

Erin: (shocked) Oh, my God. Look.

(A soldier is petting a dog on the street.)

Erin: Doesn't that dog look like Toto?

James: I suppose it does a bit, yeah.

Erin: Looks exactly like him. (pats knees) Here, boy!

(The dog doesn't respond and Erin begins running over to him. He runs.)

Erin: Come here, boy! Here, boy!

(Orla follows Erin, with her arms up pretending to be an aeroplane. The others run behind.)

Erin: Here, boy! Here, boy!

[On another road. They continue running.]

Orla: What are we doing?

Michelle: I dunno. I'm still pished.

Orla: Aye!

Clare: We're going to be late, Erin!

Erin: But it's freaky. Don't you think it's so freaky?

Clare: No! It's just a dog that looks a bit like another dog!

Erin: Quick, come on!

(Church bell tolling. The dog runs into the church and the kids follow.)

[In the church. Maureen Melarkey is praying.]

Erin: Where did he go?

Michelle: I don't really give a flying fuck.

Maureen: (stands up) Listen, you.

Erin: Yes, Mrs. Melarkey?

Maureen: You give that grandfather of yours a message from me. You tell him to keep his bloody mouth shut about my pen!

Erin: (looking terrified) Okay.

(Maureen dramatically walks away.)

Maureen: And I want my baking tray back!

(Clare is praying to a statue.)

Michelle: Of course. Trying to butter up the big woman.

Clare: Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among-

Erin: Oh, now you'll definitely pass!

Clare: It was worth a try!

Erin: Aye.

(They all kneel and begin praying.)

Michelle: I'm not gonna bother with any never sin again material, because let's face it, we've been there before. You know it's balls, I know it's balls.

(Clare gasps.)

Clare: Oh, my God.

Michelle: What is it?

Clare: She She I saw it with my own eyes.

Erin: Saw what?

Clare: (pointing at the statue) She smirked!

Michelle: Who, big M?

Clare: Aye. She just smirked at me.

Erin: Are you sure you didn't just-

Michelle: Jesus! Me, too! She just smirked at me too.

(James looks at the statue in amazement.)

James: Why isn't she smirking at me?

Erin: She isn't smirking at anyone, James.

Orla: I just saw it too! The holy smirk, thanks be to God!

Erin: You're imagining it.

Michelle: Three of us saw it, Erin. How do you explain that?

Erin: (at Clare) Sleep deprivation. (at Michelle) Pernod. (at Orla) Delusional personality disorder.

(Dog barking. Erin turns to see the dog upstairs.)

Erin: There you are.

(Dog continues to bark. Erin runs upstairs.)

Erin: Here, boy! Here, boy! I mean, it's uncanny.

Michelle: Okay. Let's do it together. Everyone look away.

(Michelle, Orla, Clare and James look away.)

Michelle: Right. So, on three

(Erin finds dog peeing. Michelle counts down.)

Erin: No, no, no, no, no, no, no! I mean, have a bit of respect.

(Michelle finishes counting down and the kids turn to face the statue. They gasp.)

Michelle: No way!

(Dog runs away. Erin feels defeated.)

Erin: What now? (she runs back downstairs)

(They all stare at the statue in amazement.)

Clare: She's crying. She's crying real tears.

(The dog pee runs down the statue's face. Erin looks guilty.)

Erin: Oh, God, please. Oh, God. No, this is bad.

Clare: (crying) I said we needed a miracle, and behold, we have been given one.

Erin: This isn't a miracle, Clare.

Clare: The exam, Erin!

Michelle: Fuck the exam. Sorry.

Erin: Listen-

Michelle: This is huge, Clare.

Erin: The thing is-

Michelle: Do you really think they'll make us sit an exam after seeing this?

Erin: You may have a point.

Michelle: Of course I have a point. We are the motherfucking children of Fatima, people!

(They celebrate. Erin looks guilty.)

[In Sister Michael's office. The kids sit around her desk.]

Sister Michael: (on phone) Could you put me through to Sister Thomas, please? (smiles) Tommy! How are you? Yeah, not too bad. On retreat? (tuts) I don't know. I have judo on Friday. Don't like to miss it. Now, I'll tell you why I'm ringing you. So, we've had an alleged apparition here this morning. Well, it's in the weeping statue category. Sure, I know. Yeah, apparently there was a smirk as well. (chuckles) I mean I'm not sure what Our Lady of the Sorrows has to be smirking about, but that's by the by.

(Woman opens the door.)

Woman: Sister, priest is here.

Sister Michael: (on phone) I'll call you back. (moves phone and stands up) Just a moment, ladies. (walks out)

Erin: Listen, girls. I didn't really think beyond the exam, or us getting out of doing it. Before this goes any further, before we talk to this priest, there is something I think you all need to know.

(Door opens.)

Sister Michael: Come in, Father.

(They turn towards the door. Handsome priest walks in in slow motion. They look amazed.)

Michelle: Fuck me.

Orla: I like his shiny hair.

James: So do I. I really like his shiny hair.

Clare: What were you saying, Erin?

Erin: (intrigued) Nothing. Ignore me. Forget it.

Father Peter: Hello, children.

(Erin gazes hungrily at him.)

All: Hello, Father.

Father Peter: Please. Call me Peter.

Sister Michael: (rolling her eyes) Christ.

[Time lapse.]

Father Peter: This is just going to be a very relaxed, informal chat.

(Erin and Michelle smile giddily.)

Father Peter: I don't want you to think of me as a priest. Think of me as a friend. Look (removes collar)

(The girls gasp softly.)

Father Peter: Just like you now.

Sister Michael: (looking bored) Dose.

Father Peter: So, before we begin, do you guys have any questions for me?

(Erin raises her hand.)

Erin: Is that your real eye colour or are they contacts?

Father Peter: These are my real eyes.

Erin: Oh. (smiles flirtatiously)

Peter: Anyone else?

(James raises his hand.)

Father Peter: Yes, James?

James: Is that a firm-hold gel you're using there? (points at hair)

Father Peter: It's a mousse.

James: And where do you-

Father Peter: Hair and Flair. (nods)

James: Oh, I didn't realise-

Father Peter: They do a men's range, yes.

(James looks amazed.)

Father James: Anyone else?

(Michelle raises her hand.)

Michelle: Have you ever done any modelling, or..?

Father Peter: No.

(Michelle looks impressed.)

Father Peter: Does anyone have any questions about what happened in the church this morning?

(Orla raises her hand, looking blank.)

Erin: No, I don't think so.

Michelle: No.

Orla: No.

James: Not really.

Clare: No. (shakes her head)

Father Peter: So you claim you saw our Blessed Lady's features change? Is that right?

Orla: The Virgin Mother smirked at us, Peter. Yeah, that is correct.

Father Peter: I see. And after that, the statue, well, you claim it started weeping.

Clare: You're using the word 'claim' a lot there, Peter.

Father Peter: Girls, I'm not here to make any judgments. I'm just trying to get the truth.

Clare: (annoyed) You think we're lying, don't you?

Father Peter: No, of course not.

Sister Michael: I do.

Father Peter: But sometimes we want to believe in something so much, that we willingly deceive ourselves. I mean, I know I've been guilty of that in the past. I wanted a sign so badly that it drove me to distraction, because it is the question we all want the answer to, isn't it? I mean, does God exist? I mean, does he exist?

(Clare looks shocked and confused.)

Father Peter: Does he?

(Sister Michael looks fed up.)

(Father Peter gazes off in distress.)

Father Peter: Or is your whole world built on a lie, Peter?

James: Peter?

Father Peter: Yeah.

(Peter comes out of daze.)

Father Peter: Directly before the weeping, can you remember what you were doing, what you were talking about?

Michelle: (raising her hand) I remember that James was being a dick.

Sister Michael: Miss Mallon.

Michelle: I don't like to use that word, Sister. But it's so hard to describe James any other way, because he's just such a dick.

(Sister Michael looks satisfied. James looks upset.)

Father Peter: I don't think you're a dick, James.

James: Really?

Father Peter: Really. And do you know who else doesn't think you're a dick? (points up) Our Lord.

Sister Michael: (rolling her eyes) For feck's sake.

Michelle: Uh, how do you know our Lord doesn't think he's a dick?

Father Peter: Our Lord doesn't think anyone's a dick.

Michelle: I very much doubt that.

Father Peter: Well, it's the truth.

[Time lapse.]

Michelle: Marti Pellow.

Father Peter: No.

Michelle: Paddy Ashdown.

Father Peter: (looking frustrated) No.

Michelle: Your man from Fun House.

Clare: Pat Sharp?
Michelle: Pat Sharp. Pat Sharp's definitely a dick.

(Clare nods.)

Father Peter: Okay.

(Michelle and Clare look at each other satisfied.)

Father Peter: The five of you attending chapel, praying together, would that be a typical morning?

(Clare looks disgusted. Michelle laughs. Father Peter turns to her.)

Erin: He's not joking, Michelle.

Michelle: Oh. Christ, fuck no. We were just following that stupid dog.

(Erin looks worried.)

Father Peter: I'm sorry?

Erin: The dog has nothing to do with anything.

Clare: See, Erin's dog died recently and she saw one that sort of looked like him a bit.

(Orla blesses herself.)

Erin: The dog's irrelevant.

Clare: So we followed him for a while. This dog

Erin: The dog and the statue are unrelated.

Clare: And he led us to the chapel.

Father Peter: The dog led you to the chapel?

(Clare nods.)

Erin: The dog isn't important.

Father Peter: Maybe it is. What if this dog you saw, Erin, what if it didn't simply look like your dog? What if it actually was your dog?

(Clare and Orla look shocked.)

Erin: (scoffs) Right. Maybe. But, as I think we mentioned, Toto's dead. My ma saw him get hit by an army Land Rover and then buried him in our back garden, so probably not.

(Father Peter stands up suddenly and flicks through book.)

Father Peter: A beloved animal, returning from the dead. Now, we've seen this before.

Orla: (raising her hand) Ohhh, ghost dog!

Father Peter: No, not ghost dog. Resurrected dog.

(They all look shocked.)

Father Peter: don't you see? Toto was sent back to lead you to that chapel, to that statue. Because you're special Erin. You have been chosen.

(Erin smiles dramatically.)

Erin: Oh, Peter. It's all just so overwhelming.

Sister Michael: (looking suspicious) Hmm.

[In the Quinn living room. Granda Joe, Mary, Gerry, Sarah, Orla, Erin, Sister Michael and Father Peter are gathered around.]

Mary: Here's what I find strange. You're in that chapel every single Sunday, yet this message from on high comes on the very day you happen to have an exam, which I know for a fact, you haven't as much as even opened a book for.

Sister Michael: I find that very strange as well, Mrs. Quinn. Very strange indeed.

Erin: What are you suggesting?

Mary: If you are lying, Erin, so help me Jesus

Erin: I'm not lying. (scoffs at Peter)

Mary: Swear. Swear on Dolly. (points at picture of Dolly Parton)

Erin: Orla saw too.

Mary: Orla's easily led.

Orla: (raising mug of tea) Aw thank you, Aunt Mary.

Father Peter: Look, I'm sure you all must have questions.

(Sarah raises her hand.)

Sarah: I have a question.

Father Peter: Yes?

Sarah: How do you stay in such good shape? (laughs) Is it exercise? Diet?

Father Peter: Combination of both.

(Sarah nods happily.)

Mary: I also have a question, pretty boy. Why are you encouraging all this?

Father Peter: I wouldn't say I'm encouraging it, I'm just open to the possibility.

Mary: Well, I'm not. Not unless I see some cold, hard evidence.

(Sister Michael nods in agreement.)

Father Peter: And maybe it's there. Proof at last, Peter, proof at last.

Mary: Is he all right?

Sister Michael: I wouldn't say so, no. He's a priest, like.

Father Peter: Why seek ye the living among the dead? He is not here but is risen. Come.  Come see the place where the Lord lay. God is inviting us to be his witness.

(Erin smiles.)

Father Peter: We must look in the burial place.

Mary: What's he saying?

Gerry: I think he's saying he wants to dig up the wee dead dog's grave.

Mary: What?

Erin: What?

Sister Michael: (disgusted) Fecking weirdo.

(Doorbell rings, knock at door. Orla looks startled.)

Erin: (gets up) I'll go. I'll get it.

(Orla follows Erin. Mary looks worried.)

(Erin opens the front door. Michelle, Clare and James stand. Clare looks worried. Michelle and James look excited.)

Michelle: It is mental out there. Everybody's talking about us. Dennis gave me free pick and mix, bonbons and all. No fucking about, like.

(Erin and Orla step aside to let them in.)

Michelle: We're basically celebrities now. We're like The Corrs.

Orla: Can I be Jim?

Clare: It's too much, Erin. I can't handle it. I think I'm going to crack.

Erin: Okay, look. This has got way out of hand. (to James) What are you wearing?

(James stands in fully black suit with mousse in his hair.)

Michelle: What did I say? You look like a fucking ballbag.

Orla: Your hair's all funny. (reaches out to feel James' hair)

James: (pushing Orla away) I just put a bit too much mousse in it, that's all.

Erin: Listen girls-

James: Get off me!

Erin: Will you listen?! It was piss!

Michelle: What was?

Erin: The tears on the statue. Well, I actually have good reason to believe they were actually dog piss.

James: No, you're not serious.

Erin: Deadly serious.

Clare: Sweet and gentle Jesus. I mean, that sort of makes sense. I'm not even sure I saw her smirk anymore. I've had a lot of caffeine.

Michelle: I definitely didn't see her smirk. I was lying, so

James: Excellent.

Erin: I was going to tell you all earlier, but then Peter showed up, and there was just this instant connection, like a spark.

Michelle: There was no spark, Erin.

(Orla shakes her head.)

Erin: He said I was special.

Michelle: He also said your dead pet had been fucking resurrected, so you know, pinch of salt.

Erin: Yes, and now he's talking about digging him up, and when he does, he'll realise that Toto has not, in fact, been resurrected. He'll realise that Toto is just dead. Very, very dead. And we've all been talking shite.

Clare: (hysterical) We need to tell the truth, now.

Michelle: No fucking way. This is the best thing that's ever happened to me. (grabs Clare) Look Clare, take a long hard look at that. (holds out free pick and mix)

(Orla tries to take some sweets. Michelle pulls away quickly. Orla shrugs and drinks tea.)

Michelle: And this is only the beginning. The Derry Journal are on their way round. They said we could make page five.

Clare: (panicking) Erin, tell her!

Erin: Yeah, we could tell the truth. But I sort of like the fact that Peter thinks I'm the chosen one, so

Clare: (still panicking) James!

James: I have a slight concern. The truth might affect my friendship with Peter.

Clare: You don't have a friendship with Peter.

James: Yes I do. We have a lot in common, Clare.

Clare: Like what? I mean apart from the fact that you appear to be wearing his clothes?

James: No, the fact that we're both very spiritual, but mainly the fact that he doesn't think I'm a dick, and neither do I.

Clare: (panicking) Come on, people! The jig is up!

(Everyone turns to Erin.)

Erin: Doesn't have to be.

[In the Quinn garden. Everyone is digging.]

(Clare looks into the distance in shame.)

Clare: What's become of us? What has become of us?

Erin: Keep an eye on that kitchen window, you.

Clare: I want no part of this.

Erin: Well, you're in too deep now, Clare.

Clare: We're stealing a body!

James: Let's just get it over with, and never, ever speak of it again.

Michelle: (looking at her nails) Jesus Christ, my nails are fucking ruined.

Erin: Less talking, more digging!

Orla: I've got something! (pulls out box and blows mud)

Erin: Give it here. (takes box)

(Michelle shakes her head in shame.)

Erin: Right. Me and Michelle go stash him somewhere, and the rest of you will fill it back in.

(James nods.)

Father Peter: Open the box, Erin!

Michelle: Oh God!

(Clare jumps.)

(Orla happily sits holding the cross.)

Faher Peter: Yes, he is with us. Do not be afraid, child.

(Erin nervously opens the box.)

(Clare gasps loudly.)

Erin: Listen, I can (she looks down and sees that the box is empty) Oh no, actually, I can't. I can't explain.

Father Peter: (looking relieved and joyful) Thanks be to God.

(James smiles and looks to the sky.)

James: Thanks be to God!

(Orla holds up the cross.)

[In the Quinn kitchen. The empty box is on the table.]

Erin: I don't understand it.

Father Peter: The Lord's work is often difficult to comprehend.

Erin: No, I mean I really, really don't understand it.

Mary: You're right, Father. He has risen. (gestures to the sky)

(Erin looks suspicious.)

Mary: It's truly a miracle.

Sarah: So, what happens now Peter?

Father Peter: Well, I think the next stage is Rome. Audience with the big man.

(Erin and Mary stare at each other.)

Orla: Pavarotti?

Gerry: John Paul the second.

(Orla smiles)

Father Peter: But first let us pray. Please, join hands. (tries to take Sister Michael's hand)

Sister Michael: I don't want you to touch me.

(Mary walks away in a fluster.)

Erin: Excuse me. (follows Mary)

(Mary is talking on the phone.)

Mary: (on phone) It is vital you keep a low profile for a bit. Do you hear me, Melarkey?

(Erin walks in. Mary stalls.)

Mary: It was nobody!

Erin: Well you could at least wait til I've asked.

Mary: Ach, give my head peace, Erin. Get back inside.

Erin: Why are you calling Maureen Melarkey? Granda says we're not allowed to speak to her.

Mary: Aw, that? That's all blown over, now.

Erin: (opening door and shouting in) Maureen Melarkey!

Granda Joe: Don't you mention that lowdown, deceitful, cheating, oul witch!

(Erin closes the door.)

Erin: Why were you ringing her, Mammy?

Mary: It's none of your business.

Erin: Fine. I'll ask her myself. (picks up phone)

Mary: Stop it, Erin.

Erin: Redial. (creepily laughs)

Mary: It was only her answer machine anyway.

Erin: Sshh. (listens to phone)

Maureen: Hello. I'm sorry to miss your call.

Mary: See? Now hang up.

Maureen: If you would like to leave a message for Maureen.

Mary: Hang up, Erin.

(Barking.)

Maureen: Toto. We'll get back to you as soon as we can.

(Erin looks shocked. Answering machine beeps. Mary looks guilty.)

Erin: You gave Toto, to Maureen Melarkey?

Mary: Wee Tigger had just passed. She was lonely.

Erin: The chapel. She was there. That dog was Toto. Oh it's all adding up now, isn't it Mammy?

Mary: It was all for the best, Erin.

Erin: You staged his death, Ma. I thought I'd lost him.

Mary: Well you have lost him. We're not taking him back.

Erin: What?!

Mary: ah, come on. He's a shit dog.

Erin: Toto was not a shit dog.

Mary: Well, he was no Gypsy.

Erin: Stop it! I'm sick of it. You can't compare every animal you have to the dog you had when you were five years old.

Mary: I can and I will.

(Doorbell rings.)

Mary: You're not going to tell your granda are you?

Erin: Well, I'm going to need some time to think about that.

(Mary looks scared.)

[Outside the Quinn house.]

(James, Erin, Orla, Michelle and Clare pose dramatically for newspaper photographer.)

(Camera shutter clicks.)

Photographer: Lovely, and another one. Beautiful. And another one.

(Erin sees Peter.)

Erin: I'll be one minute.

(Erin puts on her blazer, takes the pick and mix, and walks towards Peter.)

Erin: Bonbon?

(Peter stares at her blankly. She takes a sweet.)

Erin: What a day. (chews awkwardly on sweet) God, this is really hard.

Father Peter: Aw, it's been incredible.

Erin: Were they always this hard?

Father Peter: You know, to tell you the truth Erin, I've been having a bit of a crisis of faith recently.

Erin: Is that so? (keeps trying to chew) Seriously it's like a jawbreaker.

Father Peter: It's been very challenging.

Erin: Really? Sorry, I'm going to have to spit this out. (spits out sweet)

Father Peter: And you know, it became more challenging, when I met this amazing girl.

(Erin stares at Peter deeply, in shock.)

Father Peter: There was just this

Erin: Connection?

Father Peter: Exactly. You know, made me question everything, doubt everything.

(Erin stares at him uncertainly.)

Father Peter: I mean who knows, if God hadn't sent me this sign, I might have left the priesthood to be with her.

Erin: What if he didn't?

Father Peter: I'm sorry?

Erin: Send you the sign, I mean. Just for argument's sake.

Father Peter: Well, he did, Erin. You know, I could never abandon him now.

Erin: It's not true. (she smiles intensely)

Father Peter: What?

Erin: We're lying. We've been lying. There was no smirking, no weeping. The dog's not even dead. He's living with Maureen Melarkey. None of it's true, Peter. It's all balls! But the good news is, you're free. We're free. We can be together. (smiles intensely)

(Peter stares furiously. Erin continues smiling. Peter walks away.)

(James runs over as Erin's expression changes to regret.)

James: Peter, Peter, Peter. Where are you going? Peter, wait. I've got the most amazing news. I've had a calling. I've decided to follow  in your footsteps. I've decided to serve God. (smiles)

Father Peter: Don't be such a dick, James.

(James looks upset.)

[In the school corridor.]

Michelle: So he's just going to pack in the priesthood, like completely?

Erin: Well you can't exactly go part-time.

(Clare looks furious.)

Orla: (sucking a lollipop happily) All because of us.

Erin: Not all because of us, Orla. I mean, a bit because of us. But mostly because it turns out he had a connection with one of the colourists in Hair and Flair, who does our Sarah's forwards, by the way. And apparently she's a dirty tramp.

(Michelle smiles.)

Erin: So, you know, good luck with that, Peter.

Michelle: At least your ma was all right with Dog Piss Gate. I thought she was going to go fucking nuts.

Erin: (looking impressed with herself) Let me put it this way. I have locked my mother in a cage designed by her own hand. Oh, she has been well and truly hoist by her own petard.

Michelle: (confused) Could you put it another way? I didn't understand a word of that.

Erin: I'm sort of blackmailing her.

Michelle: Oh, happy days.

(Orla stares intensely at her lollipop.)

Clare: God, it's all so mortifying!

(James walks through door of corridor.)

Michelle: It'll all blow over soon.

(Clare looks furious.)

James: Have you seen this? (holds up newspaper)

(James passes the newspaper to Erin. Clare looks at it with worry. Front page of newspaper is a photograph of them with the headline 'Wicked Hoax'.)

Erin: Jesus Christ.

(Clare gasps and closes her eyes in humiliation.)

Michelle: No, this is good. 'Wicked' means 'good' in England, doesn't it James?

James: (thoughtful) But we're not in England, are we, Michelle?

(Orla stares into space, oblivious to what's going on.)

Michelle: And my tits look amazing in that top. (chuckles)

Erin: Well, sure, that's the main thing.

(Door opens, Sister Michael appears.)

Sister Michael: Ladies.

(They all unhappily walk into the exam room.)





















EPISODE 4

[In Church. There is a banner reading, 'We Welcome the Children of Chernobyl'.]

 Father Conway: A reading from the Holy Gospel. 

Orla: Which one's ours?

Erin: She didn't send a photo. Her family probably don't even own a camera. She'll find Derry a bit overwhelming at first, just because of how advanced everything is here. All the cracker stuff we have.

Orla: They have some pretty cracker stuff where she comes from too, Erin.

Erin: Oh really? Like what? Disease? Poverty?

Orla: No. You can get this wee woman made of wood, right? You pull her apart, and inside her there's an even wee-er wooden woman, and you pull the wee-er wooden woman apart-

Erin: Are you talking about Russian dolls?

(Sarah puts money in the basket and takes out change.)

Gerry: What are you doing?

Sarah: Taking my change.

Gerry: Sarah, you don't get change.

Sarah: Aye, dead on, Gerry. I'm gonna give them a whole fiver? That's definitely happening.

(Granda Joe winks at a woman.)

Mary: Did you just wink?

Granda Joe: No.

Mary: You did. You just winked.

Granda Joe: Sure winking's not in my notion, Mary. What would I have to be winking about?

Mary: I don't know. But I'll find out.

Father Conway: This is the word of the Lord.

(The congregation sit down.)

Father Conway: And today we welcome some very special guests. The wains from Chernobyl, who've come over to give their wee lungs a bit of a clear out, because, ah, sure, there's all sorts wafting about in their neck of the woods. (to Sister Michael) Sister.

Sister Michael: Lovely job so far, Seamus, but you know, keep it moving. (stands up) Rawhide's on in fifteen minutes. Now, one might well question the wisdom of sending you here, of all places. Out of the frying pan and into the well maybe not the fire but certainly a different type of frying pan. Or some sort of wok at the very least. But please, don't worry yourselves too much about the whole civil war, sectarian conflict carry on. There's really only one thing you need to know. We're the goodies. Welcome to Derry.

[On the street. The whole Quinn family and Katya walk.]

Erin: It's class, isn't it?

Katya: (unamused) Hmm. It is much how I imagine.

Erin: Oh, because of my letters? Well, descriptive narrative has always been a strong point-

Katya: No, not your letters. I see on news.

Erin: What do you mean, you've seen on news? You don't have news in the Ukraine. You don't have televisions.

Katya: Yes, we do.

Erin: No, you don't.

Katya: We do.

Erin: Really?

Katya: Of course.

Mary: Erin, stop hogging the Russian.

Gerry: Yeah, come on Erin. Will you give Orla a go.

Erin: She's Ukrainian actually.

Sarah: Yeah, go on, love. Say something to Katya.

Orla: Your name sounds a bit like 'cat'.

Sarah: (amazed) God aye, so it does.

Granda Joe: You don't know a Jack McGinley, do you? Moved to Moscow, 88, 89, it would have been.

Erin: Seriously?

Katya: No.

Granda Joe: Stocky fella.

Katya: No.

Granda Joe: Curly hair. Bit of a lisp.

Katya: I do not know this person.

Granda Joe: Ah, maybe just as well, love. He's an awful prick.

(Katya does not look amused. Mary smiles at Katya.)

[In Erin's bedroom. Erin and Orla sit with Katya.]

Erin: So, Katya, I've done a bit of an itinerary for your stay. You should have received a copy in my last letter?

Katya: I don't read your letters, Erin.

Erin: (offended) I'm sorry? I don't follow.

Katya: Your letters, they bore.

Erin: They're boring.

Katya: Exactly.

Erin: That's not what I-

Katya: I can smoke here, yes? (pulls out cigarette)

Erin: No. No you can't. (grabs cigarette) Mammy's like a bloodhound.

(Clare, Michelle and James appear at the door, looking interested.)

Michelle: Your ma said we could come up and have a look at the Russian.

Erin: Ukrainian. 

Michelle: Is this her?

(They rush into the room.)

(Orla stares at Katya in fascination.)

Orla: Isn't she cracker? She's half mine.

Erin: No, she's not, Orla.

Orla: Aye, she is. Mammy said so.

Michelle: You're so lucky, Erin. I begged my ma to let me have one, but she said we've no room now that my dickhead, ballbag, English prick of a cousin's moved in. I'm talking about you James, in case you're wondering.

James: Yeah, that much was clear. Thank you, Michelle.

Michelle: Have you seen the one Jenny Joyce got, the fella? Massive, massive ride. I've been thinking. Might be time for me to lose the rest of my virginity. And he's definitely a contender.

(Katya looks uncomfortable and annoyed.)

Michelle: You. Help. Me. You put in good word with your Cossack friend. So we can (makes sex gestures)

Erin: Would you stop that?

Clare: (in Katya's face) I'm very sorry for all your trouble, you know, the whole hoo-ha at the power plant.

Katya: (unamused) Okay.

Clare: When you think about it, we've actually got a lot in common, cause we understand what it's like to be a young person from a troubled place.

Katya: It is not the same.

(Clare looks annoyed.)

Katya: Chernobyl was a terrible nuclear accident. You people like to fight each other, and to be honest, no person really understands why.

Erin: Well, there's actually a political element to it, Katya, and there's a religious element.

(Clare nods. Orla continues to stare at Katya.)

Katya: Mmm, but you're not two different religions here. You're different flavours of same religion, no?

Erin: Well, yes, but, it's a little bit more complicated than that, Katya.

Katya: (looking bored) To me, it's stupid.

Clare: (sudden realisation) Oh my God. It is stupid.

(Katya looks impatient.)

Clare: It is so, so stupid.

(James peers over Clare's head.)

Katya: (to James) Who is this?

Erin: Oh, that's just James.

Katya: You are handsome.

(James looks surprised and happy.)

Katya: And also sexy.

(Erin looks confused and suspicious.)

Michelle: Is her English not great?

(Katya looks bored. She gets up and suddenly kisses James.)

(Everyone watches in shock.)

Clare: What's happening..?

Erin: Why would she do that? Why?

Michelle: Fuck knows. He's minging.

Orla: She seems to be really enjoying it.

(James' eyes are wide as Katya continues to kiss him and run her hands through his hair.)

Erin: Is he enjoying it?

Michelle: It's hard to tell.

Clare: Well, if he's not enjoying it, isn't that sort of sexual harassment?

(James is in a state of shock. Katya is still kissing him.)

Erin: Yeah, we should put a stop to it.

Clare: Aye.

Orla: Does anyone want a Fruit Pastille?

(James is cross-eyed as Clare, Erin, Orla and Michelle continue to watch them kiss while eating Fruit Pastilles.)

[In the Quinn kitchen. They're eating dinner.]

Katya: (blankly) And when Erin finished reading me her poetry, she showed me some old walls.

Erin: (offended) I showed you the walls. I showed you the city walls, and they are nothing short of spectacular.

Sarah: (buttering bread) Ach, if she's not into walls, she's not into walls, Erin, love.

Mary: Have you any news, Da?

Granda Joe: Not really, no.

Mary: Right. Shay Harkin was telling me you were in Duggan's bakery yesterday lunchtime.

Granda Joe: Well, that's hardly news.

Mary: Two buns he says you ordered.

Granda Joe: I often do.

Mary: An apple turnover, and a cream horn.

Sarah: (shocked) A cream horn?

Erin: (shocked) That's not like you, Granda.

Sarah: Sure, you couldn't pay you to eat a cream horn.

Granda Joe: Cream finger, it was. Apple turnover and a cream finger.

Mary: Cream horn, Shay said.

Katya: Horns, fingers, who cares?

Mary: He swore on it. Said he saw it being bagged up.

Sarah: And big Shay has eyes like a hawk, so he does.

(Granda Joe looks caught off guard.)

Mary: Shay said when you left Duggan's, you turned up Pump Street.

Sarah: Pump Street? Who do you know on Pump Street, Da?

Mary: What were you doing heading up Pump Street with a cream horn, Da?

Granda Joe: I was visiting a friend of mine.

Mary: What friend?

Granda Joe: A new friend.

Mary: (raising her eyebrows) A male friend, was it?

(Granda Joe looks guilty and shrugs.)

Mary: Aye, I thought as much.

(Sarah looks shocked. Katya looks bored.)

Mary: Buying cream horns for his fancy woman. Sarah what do you think of that?

Granda Joe: We met at the Stations of the Cross.

Erin: Which station?

Granda Joe: Jesus falls for the second time.

Sarah: (looking traumatised) I could do without the details, Da.

Granda Joe: Maeve and me, we, we just get on well, that's all.

Mary: Maeve? That's her name, is it?

Granda Joe: Yes, that's right.

Mary: Maeve? That's what she's called, is she?

Granda Joe: She is, aye.

Mary: Maeve. Maeve. Really? Maeve?

Katya: Why does your mother make that sound?

Mary: I cannot believe this.

Gerry: I think it's a good thing, love.

Granda Joe: Ach, just keep out of it, you.

Mary: And that's who you were winking at in mass?

Sarah: (appalled) Winking? At your age? Christ, I feel sick.

Granda Joe: It was only a friendly wink.

Mary: There's no such thing as a friendly wink.

Gerry: Is there not?

Mary: Our poor mother is barely cold. (holds Sarah's hand) And you're straight back out there, winking away.

Gerry: Your mother's been dead ten years, Mary.

Granda Joe: Look, I'll not tell you again.

Mary: (stands up) I'm sorry. I seem to have lost my appetite. (walks away upset)

Granda Joe: (to Gerry) You happy now?!

[In Brennans diner. Katya is ordering food at the till.]

Erin: I don't know. I just find her a bit, 'I have a fringe and cigarettes and opinions', and she's also a bit, you know, 'I hate walls' and she's just not-

Clare: Oh, the grateful little peasant girl you ordered?

Erin: Yeah. No. I just don't trust her, okay? And that thing she said about my letters being boring, I really think she's playing some sort of twisted psychological mind game here.

Michelle: Or maybe your letters are just really fucking dull, Erin.

Erin: (defensive) My letters are a gripping read.

James: I'm not comfortable with you talking about my girlfriend like this.

Erin: Ah ha! And she also fancies James. You don't find that a bit weird?

Michelle: Aye, that is a bit fucked up, in fairness.

Clare: Aye, I can't get my head around it. (gazes at James)

Erin: I'm telling you, she's up to something.

Michelle: Even so, I need her to put a word in with that big Russian ride.

Orla: And I really like the fact that she glows in the dark.

James: I'm sorry?

Orla: (obviously) Because of the radiation, they all glow in the dark.

(Everyone has blank expressions.)

James: Right.

Clare: She's also opened my eyes about how we need to break down barriers here, to longer define ourselves as Irish or British, Catholic or Protestant, but simply as human, with human hearts and human heads and human hands and other human qualities, because at the end of the day, we're all humans. (she looks inspired)

(Michelle looks confused.)

(Katya sits down with her food.)

Katya: Hi.

(She kisses James. Erin looks repulsed.)

(Jenny and her Ukrainian walk in. She has him on a leash.)

Michelle: Incoming ride. I repeat, incoming ride.

Jenny: Hi everyone. This is Artem.

Michelle: (flirtatiously) Well, hello, Artem.

(He looks terrified. Michelle smiles.)

Michelle: (to Katya) Go on, then.

Katya: (moody, in Ukrainian) She wants to have sex with you.

(He still looks terrified.)

Jenny: He doesn't say much.

James: Is he Is he tied to you?

Jenny: Yeah, he kept wandering off.

(Orla nods in understanding.)

Jenny: Listen, I've a feeling Artem and a few of the others are a bit homesick. I'd be nice for them to spend some time together. So I'm having a bit of a soiree at my place tonight. It's going to be great. I've got a chocolate fountain and everything!

(Orla looks amazed.)

Erin: Well, chocolate fountain or not, I'd actually prefer to keep our Ukrainians separate, so

(David Donnelly walks in.)

Erin: Oh, Christ, David. David Donnelly's just come in. David's here. Right. Okay. Don't look. Nobody look.

(Orla stares.)

David: (to Jenny) So do you have a playlist for tonight then?

Jenny: I'll need the sound system set up by seven.

Erin: Is your band playing at this thing tonight?

David: Oh Christ no, I just do a wee bit of DJ-ing at the side. Make a bit of extra cash. Wacca-wacca, cha-ching!

(Erin giggles.)

David: Oh, my band, we don't really do covers. Do you know what I mean? In this game, you need a wee bit of integrity.

Jenny: Now whatever you do, don't forget the Grease mega mix.

(David looks ashamed.)

David: Yep. (walks up to till)

Erin: Actually, on second thoughts, I think this party would be really great for Katya. Might help bring her out of her shell a bit.

(Jenny looks pleased and then looks shocked as she sees James and Katya kissing.)

[In Erin's bedroom. Katya is getting ready for the party. Erin walks in.]

Erin: Oh, you look very (looks shocked) Booby.

Katya: Yes, I like. We go now?

(Erin looks disappointingly at her outfit. Then she sees Katya's bag.)

Erin: Katya!

(Katya doesn't respond so she looks inside Katya's bag.)

Erin: Well, well, well.

[At Jenny Joyce's house. Some girls walk into the house. Disco lights flash and music blares.]

(David Donnelly is DJ-ing. He looks bored.)

(Michelle is drinking vodka. Erin approaches.)

Michelle: Size of this motherfucking house!

Erin: Listen, I think James might be in real trouble.

Michelle: Right. I'm struggling to give a shit, if I'm honest.

(Ukrainian boy approaches.)

Ukrainian boy: Where is Katya?

Erin: I don't know, why?

Ukrainian boy: I must I must give. (holds up money and walks away)

(Erin looks deeply concerned.)

(Clare walks up wearing a Union Jack t-shirt. She looks pleased with herself.)

Clare: Hi, girls.

Michelle: Have you got a Union Jack splashed across your tits Clare?

(Erin looks appalled.)

Clare: I'm making a point.

Michelle: Is the point 'I'd like to get beaten up'?

Clare: Me wearing this, it should be meaningless. These are just colours and shapes. This flag is not an identity. We need to take the power out of these symbols!

Michelle: Genuine question. Why can't you just be fucking normal?

(Erin nods. Clare looks annoyed.)

(Orla approaches with chocolate all over her face.)

Michelle: Enjoy the chocolate fountain, Orla?

Orla: Very much so.

(Jenny comes down the stairs.)

Erin: Focus, girls.

Jenny: (panicking) Has anyone seem Artem? I untied him for his toilet privileges half an hour ago, and now I can't find him!

(Everyone looks shocked.)

Michelle: What?!

Erin: Listen, I know this might be a bit shocking, but I think Katya is planning on taking James' virginity tonight. I found condoms in her bag, actual condoms! Like I don't even think they're legal in Derry.

Michelle: Wise up, Erin.

Erin: We have to stop her!

(Song starts playing. Orla looks excited while holding her chocolate marshmallows.)

Orla: Yes!!

Clare: Yes!

Michelle: Tune!

Clare: It's our song, girls. It's our song!

(James runs over.)

James: I've lost Katya!

Erin: Good.

Michelle: Let's hit the floor girls!

(They all run to the dancefloor and dance.)

Erin: She doesn't love him. She's just using him. She just wants something to do. But she can't do James. He's not a pastime or plaything.

(James dances in sync with everyone, but looks miserable.)

Michelle: Ach, Erin, if she wants to ride James, just let her ride James. Nobody else is ever gonna want to touch the poor fucker.

Clare: I mean, maybe it's just his time. We're all going to have sex at some point.

Michelle: You probably won't, Clare.

Erin: Aye I can't see that either, to be honest, Clare.

(Clare stops dancing and looks offended.)

(James stops dancing and leaves the room.)

(Michelle sees Artem.)

Michelle: There you are.

(Artem looks terrified.)

Michelle: Oh, playing hard to get, are we Artem?

Erin: Or he could be, you know, just not interested.

Michelle: Come off it!

(Michelle stops dancing and leaves the room. Erin realises James is gone.)

Erin: Shit! James! (she runs out)

[In the Quinn living room.]

Mary: How could he bring another woman into this house?

(Mary picks up a photo of her mother.)

Mary: How could he bring her here, into our mother's home.

Gerry: Your mother never lived in this house.

Mary: Shut up, Gerry.

(Granda Joe and Maeve walk in.)

Granda Joe: Right, come on in there, Maeve.

(Mary looks distraught.)

Granda Joe: Now, these are my daughters.

(Maeve smiles kindly.)

Granda Joe: That's Mary, and this is Sarah.

Sarah: (coldly) Hello, Maeve.

Mary: Maeve.

(Gerry approaches Maeve and shakes her hand.)

Gerry: I'm Mary's husband, Gerry. We're Mary and Gerry, and we're living in Derry. (smiles)

(Maeve chuckles. Joe groans.)

Gerry: (awkwardly) I'll get the tea going.

Granda Joe: Right. I'll just grab my beads. Be back in a minute.

(Meave nods and smiles.)

Granda Joe: Just make yourself comfortable.

Mary: You'll not have to ask Maeve twice.

(Granda Joe leaves the room.)

Maeve: Sorry, love, did you say something?

Mary: Gerry's name is on the house. Not my da's. If that's what you were thinking.

Maeve: (confused) If what's what I'm thinking?

Gerry: Hobnob? Custard cream?

(Maeve smiles at the biscuits.)

Gerry: Wagon wheel?

Sarah: What age are you, Maeve? Like, thirty?

Maeve: (taking a wagon wheel) I'm sixty-two.

Sarah: Sugar daddy you're after, is it?

Mary: I just want to let you know, Maeve, we'll never call you 'mammy'.

Maeve: (confused) Okay.

Sarah: And I just wanna say, although I'm not happy about this thing with me da, I have to give it to you. That is a cracker blow-dry. Great volume. Lovely movement.

(Maeve smiles. Mary slaps Sarah.)

[In Jenny Joyce's house. Party continues.]

(Michelle is chasing Artem. He runs into a room and tries to close the door. She stops him.)

Michelle: Come on, Artem. You want me and I want you. Let's stop playing these games.

Artem: Look, I don't want any trouble. I'm begging you, just leave me alone, please!

Michelle: Why are you suddenly Irish?

(He looks terrified. She pushes into the room with him and slams the door.)

[Jenny Joyce's house, downstairs by the chocolate fountain.]

Jenny: Queue to the right-hand side, please. One Chupa Chup per person.

(James is putting food on his plate. Erin walks in.)

Erin: James, listen, I have something to tell you, and (looks at snack table) Ooh, Dip Dab. Okay. I'm just going to say it. I think Katya is planning on having sex with you, tonight. (puts food in mouth)

James: (smiling) I know.

Erin: (shocked) You know?

James: I'm meeting her upstairs in a bit. She told me to have some food first. Apparently, sex uses up a lot of energy.

Erin: (horrified) You do not want to do this, James.

James: Yes, I do.

Erin: You're not ready for it.

James: I am.

Erin: She doesn't love you, James. She's just using you.

James: (lifting more food) Yeah, but the thing is, I don't care.

Erin: I won't let you. I won't let you do it.

James: You can't stop me!

Erin: Fine. In that case, I'll just come and watch.

James: What?

(James walks out of the room and Erin follows him.)

Erin: You heard me, James. If you insist on going through with this, well, I'm- I'm gonna make sure you don't enjoy it.

(David appears in front of Erin.)

David: I'm skiving. Say nothing. Oh, Jenny's a bit of a head melter, isn't she?

(Erin, blocked by David, sees James walking up the stairs.)

Erin: What? Oh, yeah. Big time.

David: I've got some beers, if you fancy a sneaky one.

Erin: Just give me one minute. I just have to I'll be right back. Just stay here. One minute.

(Erin approaches the stairs and gets stopped by another Ukrainian boy.)

Ukrainian boy: Where's Katya?

Erin: I don't know. Up there somewhere, trying to mount my friend.

Ukrainian boy: (holds up money) I owe.

Erin: (looking shocked) And the plot thickens.

[In the Quinn kitchen.]

Mary: Can you believe him? Flaunting it in our faces like this.

Sarah: I don't even know the man anymore.

(Granda Joe is praying with Maeve.)

Granda Joe: Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. Amen.

Maeve: Amen.

Mary: (furious) Unbelievable.

Gerry: Jammy dodger?

(Sarah continues staring at her dad and Maeve, while taking a jammy dodger from Gerry.)

Maeve: Blessed art thou, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

[In Jenny Joyce's house.]

(Erin is running around looking for James. She opens a door.)

Erin: James?

(She closes the door and continues running. She opens another door.)

Erin: James?

(She closes the door and runs again.)

Erin: Is there any need for the size of this place?

(She opens another door, where Michelle sits with the fake Artem.)

Erin: James?

Michelle: (has a phone at her ear, turns to Erin) All right?

Erin: What is going on?

Michelle: Trying to sort Clive out.

Erin: Clive? Who's Clive?

(James runs in.)

James: Christ!

Erin: (repulsed) You dirty, dirty brute!

James: (shocked) I beg your pardon?

Erin: I know what you're up to.

James: (agitated) I'm not up to anything. I should be up to something, but I can't find the person I'm supposed to be up to it with, because this place is like a fucking maze!

Michelle: Shh, you'll scare Clive.

James: Who's Clive?

Michelle: Clive. Clive is a wee prod from East Belfast. Clive came back from Ibiza, got on the wrong bus at Aldergrove Airport, then fell asleep. Clive woke up in Derry, surrounded by Russians and Fenians. Clive is absolutely shitting himself.

Erin: So where's the real Artem?

Michelle: Giant's Causeway, probably.

(James looks confused.)

Michelle: Foreigners fucking love the Giant's Causeway.

(Erin and Clive turn to look at James.)

Clive: (maniacally) I just wanna go home, but she won't let me leave. She won't let me leave!

Michelle: Um, I also think Clive may have had too many disco biscuits on his holidays.

(Clare walks in.)

Clare: Here you are!

(Clive turns to Clare, sees the Union Jack on her t-shirt and suddenly looks relieved.)

Clive: Thank God.

(Clive kneels before Clare.)

Clive: Whatever you do, don't slag off the Pope. (whispers) We're outnumbered.

(Clare looks terrified. Orla walks in with two handfuls of chocolate covered marshmallows.)

Erin: Oh, for God's sake Orla, you're going to make yourself boke.

Orla: I can handle that.

(Katya walks in.)

Katya: James, what is going on? I wait long time. You no longer want to do sex?

James: (desperately) No, no, no, I do want to do sex. I really, really want to do sex.

Katya: Come. (starts walking out)

(James follows Katya out of the room.)

Erin: You disgust me. (she follows them) You should be ashamed of yourself.

James: Piss off, Erin!

(Katya looks annoyed.)

Erin: I mean, I know you're desperate James, but paying for it?

(They turn suddenly.)

James: What?

Erin: You really thought I wouldn't work it out?

James: (looking horrified) Work what out? What the actual cock are you talking about?

Erin: I'm talking about the fact that she's a prostitute!

(Everyone gasps. Katya looks disgusted.)

Katya: (scoffs) I am prostitute?

Erin: Oh, come off it, James. She's charging you for it, isn't she? Just admit it.

James: No. I mean, I don't think so. (turning to Katya) I mean, not that I wouldn't consider it.

Katya: (angry) Ugh! How dare you?

(Jenny walks up the stairs.)

Katya: I am poor Ukrainian, so I must be prostitute.

(Erin runs to the stairs.)

Erin: Hear me out. First, she comes on to James here. What would possess her? Financial gain, that's what.

Katya: He attractive boy, Erin.

Erin: He's English, Katya.

Katya: I have no problem with this.

Michelle: You should.

Erin: Secondly, she owns condoms.

(Everyone looks embarrassed.)

Erin: They're in her bag. A whole packet. I've seen them, people!

Katya: You are imbecile.

Erin: An imbecile. And thirdly, all night, wee Ukrainian fellas have been coming up and giving her money they owe her. How the hell do you explain that?

Katya: I organise, how you say it, whip-round. We like to buy Jenny present to thank her for nice party.

Jenny: (smiling) Oh, you guys!

(Erin looks defeated and embarrassed.)

Erin: Right. Okay. Yeah, that does sort of explain it.

Michelle: Dickhead.

Clare: Really, Erin.

Katya: So not only you insult me, but you've also spoiled Jenny's surprise.

(Erin looks guilty.)

Jenny: (offended) I think you should leave.

Erin: Yeah. But great evening all the same, Jenny. You're a credit to yourself. (walks down the stairs with shame)

(Clare, Michelle, James, Orla and Clive follow.)

[In the Quinn living room.]

Mary: Come on Katya, love. Let's talk about this, please.

Katya: I am finished talking. (points at Erin) She is racist, patronizing bitch.

Erin: I am a racist, patronizing bitch.

Granda Joe: Now, come on girls. Language, please.

Mary: Well, you don't really wanna go to Jenny Joyce's house, do you, love?

Katya: Yes, I do. Apart from anything, it has eight bedrooms and a chocolate fountain.

(Orla licks chocolate off her fingers happily.)

Mary: I hope you're happy, Erin. You've just done us out of a Russian.

Erin: Ukrainian.

(Katya picks up her bag.)

Katya: Good for you, Mr. Joe. She is hot, and you are not dead yet. Why not have some fun?

(Mary folds her arms angrily.)

(Katya passes her bag to Gerry and they begin to walk out, Katya glaring at Erin.)

(Gerry helps Katya into the taxi while everyone watches from the window.)

Sarah: Tell me this. Does Jenny Joyce's house really have eight bedrooms?

Orla: Aye. And some of the bedrooms, they have these wee, tiny bathrooms attached to them.

(Sarah looks amazed.)

Sarah: Imagine!

(Erin looks guilty.)

[Time lapse. Maeve is leaving.]

Maeve: Your girls, they're just not ready, Joe.

(Joe looks disappointed.)

Maeve: Maybe see you in mass, then, eh?

Granda Joe: Aye.

Maeve: Here, give me your hand. Tell Sarah this is the fella that blow-dries my hair. (she writes on Joe's hand) He's an artist. (she leaves)

(Joe smiles.)

Gerry: Take care.

(Gerry closes the door behind her.)

Gerry: That Maeve away?

(Joe nods sadly.)

Granda Joe: Aye.

Gerry: (nods and smiles) Nice woman.

Granda Joe: Aye.

Gerry: Mary and Sarah will come round eventually, Joe. It's just hard for them to see you with somebody else, you know. As far as they're concerned, their mother was perfect.

Granda Joe: (smiles) Piss off, Gerry.

(Gerry nods and walks away.)

Granda Joe: (picks up photo of his wife) And they're right. You were perfect. (smiles sadly)

EPISODE 5

[On the street. Orange men are practicing for 12th of July parades.]

[In the Quinn kitchen. Banging of drums is causing everything in the house to shake.]

Mary: (dragging suitcase into the room) Already? They've started already?!

Gerry: (carrying baby) I think it's just a rehearsal, love.

Mary: They've been playing the same three songs since 1795. What do they need to rehearse for?

Orla: (banging wooden spoons against her legs like drums) Well, practice makes perfect, Aunt Mary. You know, that is why they are so cracker.

Erin: I'm sorry? Did you just call the Orange Order 'cracker'?

Orla: I'm considering joining.

Erin: I don't think they accept Catholics, Orla. Or you know, acknowledge our right to exist.

(Mary is struggling to close the suitcase.)

Mary: Give us a hand here, Gerry. This'll not close.

(Gerry walks over and tries to close the suitcase.)

Mary: We need to shift ourselves. We're the last Fenians standing!

Granda Joe: Relax, love. We've a good two or three hours before the rioting starts.

Mary: I'll not settle myself until we're over that border, Da.

(Gerry opens the suitcase to reveal a massive clock.)

Gerry: And you're absolutely certain we need the big clock, love?

Mary: We've been through this, Gerry.

Gerry: Definitely don't want to bring the wee clock?

Mary: I can't be doing with the wee clock.

(Orla is still playing with the wooden spoons.)

Granda Joe: What exactly is your problem with the big clock?

Gerry: I wouldn't say I have a problem, as such. It's just much heavier and takes up a lot of room.

Granda Joe: I'm telling you, Mary. That's how it starts. Now he's dictating what size of clock you can pack. Next he'll be telling you what to wear, what to say. Before you know it, you'll be faking your own death, assuming a new identity.

Mary: Erin! I told you not to let him watch that 'Sleeping with the Enemy'.

Erin: Couldn't stop him, Mammy.

Granda Joe: Great show.

Mary: (to Gerry) Stick that in the boot.

(Gerry grunts and tries to lift the suitcase.)

Granda Joe: You'll be as well getting one of the wains to do it. (stands up) Out of the way.

(Granda Joe groans and lifts the suitcase with ease, then walks outside. Mary and Gerry exchange a look.)

Gerry: Right.

(Clare runs in, frantically.)

Clare: Listen to it. I mean, just listen to it! They can't, I mean, they don't I mean why do they have to be so loud?!

Mary: Breathe, love.

Erin: It's far worse for me, Clare. I mean, my hearing's impeccable.

Clare: (holding up a copy of Moby Dick) I've read the same paragraph forty-seven times, because I can't concentrate because Oh, my God, the noise! This whale, he's a bad brute, Mrs. Quinn. I have to know if they catch him. Can I come away with you, please?

Mary: Okay, well if your mother has no objections, I don't see why not.

(Clare lets out a sign of relief.)

Clare: Thank you. Thank you. I'll never forget this. Thank you!

Erin: She's taking you to a caravan in Portnoo. She's not giving you a kidney, Clare.

(Sarah walks in.)

Sarah: Listen, Mary. I just did a reading. The cards say if we go on this wee holiday, we're placing ourselves in grave danger, which I'm not buzzing about, to be honest.

Erin: You're not psychic, Aunt Sarah.

Sarah: (holding cards) I am psychic, Erin. I did a course. I got a certificate.

(She places three cards on the table. Granda Joe watches.)

Sarah: Aye, this does not look good.

Granda Joe: Still no sign of the lottery numbers?

Sarah: Naw, Daddy, this psychic carry-on, it's not all it's cracked up to be, you know. Last night, I woke up to this wailing sound.

(Orla stops banging the wooden spoons and looks at her interestedly.)

Sarah: I thought to myself, Jesus it's Granny Pat. She's trying to cross over.

(Mary looks interested.)

Sarah: Now, it turned out it was only Aggie next door. She'd put the electric blanket on full whack and scalded the legs off herself. But still, it could just as easily have been-

Erin: (unimpressed) The disembodied spirit of a dead relative?

Sarah: Exactly. My nerves are wrecked. I'm living on a knife's edge, here. Is there any Rice Krispies?

Orla: Shh! Shh! This is the best bit!

(Orla excitedly bangs her wooden spoon against a mug, knocking it to the floor where it breaks.)

Mary: Okay, everyone! Remain calm! I need you all to listen very carefully.

[Time lapse.]

Mary: Okay, I'm going in. (She sweeps up broken mug with dustpan and brush.)

(Deidre, Michelle and James walk in. Deidre knocks.)

Mary: For the love of God! Don't come in here!

(They walk in anyway.)

Deidre: Everything all right, Mary?

(The whole family are standing on chairs or sitting on the table.  Clare is reading Moby Dick.)

Mary: Stay back, Deidre. This place is a death trap.

Deidre: Listen Mary, I hate to do this to you, but me and Martin are both working nights, and I'm nervous about leaving these two on their own, what with the day that's in it. Don't suppose there's any chance you could take them with you?

Mary: Ach away, Deidre, it's just-

Deidre: The English thing?

(James looks upset.)

Deidre: Listen Mary, I understand. I mean, he's my nephew, and even I find it hard to get past. If I'm totally honest, there's times when I look at him and I feel  (she looks at James) Well It's pure hatred. I'll not dress it up.

Mary: No, no, it's not the English thing.

Deidre: Hope to God it's not the gay thing you're offended by.

James: (still looking upset) There is no gay thing.

Deidre: Because I'd be disappointed in you, Mary. I'll not lie.

Mary: Of course not. I mean, if anything the gay thing sort of cancels out the English thing.

James: Again, no gay thing.

Michelle: You wouldn't move over there, James? I can't see past your massive closet.

Mary: I'm just not sure we'll have room in the caravan.

Granda Joe: It'll be grand. Us men can camp outside.

Gerry: (buries his head in his hand) Oh, God.

James: Oh, God.

(Michelle looks happy.)

Granda Joe: Run and ask Jim across the road for the lend of his tent.

Deidre: Aw, thanks a million Mary. I owe you one. Here, if you want our Ryan to sort that gable wall of yours out, you've only to ask.

(Mary looks appalled.)

Mary: What's wrong with our gable wall?

[Outside the Quinn house. 'Up the rebellies' is painted on the side of their house.]

Mary: Christ's sake!

Sarah: Do you think it's an omen?

[In Jim's house.]

Jim: Right. Now watch.

(Jim closes the window and the sound is completely blocked out.)

Jim: What about that?

Orla: (amazed) Wow!

Jim: I tell you, girls, the double glazing, it'll change your life.

Erin: (looking frustrated) Yeah, as I said, it's It's very impressive, Jim, but we're actually in a bit of a hurry.

(Michelle is smoking. Clare is reading Moby Dick.)

Erin: So if we could just grab that tent.

(Jim opens the window again. Orla signals to Erin to be quiet. He closes the window.)

Orla: Mind-blowing.

[Outside the Quinn house. Sarah, Granda Joe, Mary and Gerry are staring at the mural with Joe holding the baby.]

Mary: What are they, stilts?

Granda Joe: Golf clubs.

Sarah: I thought spatulas.

Gerry: They're rifles!

Sarah: Really? Are you sure?

Gerry: Fairly sure. I also don't understand what connection spatulas, golf clubs or stilts would have to the Irish resistance.

Granda Joe: Christ, he's a dose.

[In Jim's house.]

(Jim sits inside his tent with Orla. Clare continues reading.)

Jim: Now, once your tent is erect

(Michelle snorts with laughter.)

Jim: You'll want to think about where to safely store your food, because believe me, girls, you do not want to attract predatory animals into your sleeping area. Bears are particularly vicious.

Erin: Yeah, I'm not sure how many bears there are in Portnoo, though, Jim.

Orla: But there was a cheetah on the beach one time.

Erin: That was a greyhound, Orla.

Orla: (smiling at Jim) I know what I saw.

[Outside the Quinn house. Joe is attaching suitcases to car roof.]

(The kids walk out of Jim's house, James carrying the tent.)

Granda Joe: (to James) Gave you the Intrepid, did he? (he smiles) That's his second best test, you know? Tell you what, son. I'm putting you in charge of it, okay?

James: (looking scared) Oh, please don't. Please don't put me in charge of it.

Granda Joe: (patting James on the shoulder) You'll be all right.

Mary: (carrying the baby) Right, there's too many of us for one car. Some of you will have to go with my da.

Michelle: Can I? Can I? (to James) Cause Joe drives really fast. He like, runs through red lights and takes corners on two wheels. It is class!

(James and Clare look scared.)

Orla: (to Clare) It really is!

James: I think I'll hop in with Mr. Quinn, if that's okay.

Clare: Me too!

Sarah: (smoking) I'll go with me da. He lets me smoke.

Mary: You're coming? What about the grave danger we're putting ourselves in?

Sarah: Well, it's a concern, but so is the fact that I have nothing in for me Sunday dinner, so

Gerry: All right, Joe, if you just follow me.

Granda Joe: Now, why should I follow you?

Gerry: I've got the map.

Granda Joe: Aye. (grabs map from Gerry) Well now I have the map.

(Gerry looks annoyed.)

Mary: Ach, Da!

Gerry: Joe, it's all just a bit trickier today. There are so many roadblocks up, there are so many diversions, and you know, I drive for a living.

Granda Joe: He says this like it's something to be proud of.

Gerry: Look, we just need to get out of this place as quickly and as quietly as possible.

Granda Joe: You know what age I am, boy?

(Sarah and Orla watch interestedly.)

Granda Joe: You know how many of these parades I've lived through? You think I don't realise how quickly a situation can turn? Do you think I'd do anything to put my family at risk?

Gerry: No, of course not. I'm sorry.

Granda Joe: (standing close to Gerry, staring) Aye.

[In the middle of the parade, both cars drive slowly.]

Granda Joe: (shouting from car) What are you looking at, you tangerine tool?

Erin: Okay, Granda.

Gerry: I think what's happened here is, now correct me if I'm wrong, but I think your father has just driven through a police barricade.

(Clare looks scared and hugs her book.)

Mary: Well, it's done now.

Gerry: Oh, that's true. It's probably not even that big a deal, if you ignore the fact that Orangemen are circling us as though we're their fucking prey!

(Orangeman threateningly gestures at Gerry.)

Mary: It'll be grand.

(James looks terrified.)

Clare: I'm starting to understand how Moby Dick must feel.

Gerry: Christ, I'm sweating here. (puts down the window)

(Mary and Gerry inaudibly argue.)

Granda Joe: You lot tell me where I can and can't go in me own town?! Orange bastards!

(Orla looks satisfied.)

Sarah: (smoking) Sure, didn't I predict this?

Erin: No, you didn't.

Sarah: I said this trip would place us in grave danger, Erin. Those were my very words. 

Erin: This isn't grave danger.

Orla: (pointing) Oh, look. That cop's pointing his gun at us.

Erin: (worried) I mean, it's not ideal, but this is more of a pickle. (leans forward to Joe) Isn't a pickle, isn't it Granda? It's just a pickle.

Granda Joe: Arseholes!

Erin: Okay, then.

Michelle: So, would you do me a reading, Sarah?

Sarah: I would surely, love.

(Michelle looks pleased.)

Erin: Grow up, Michelle. Deck of cards can't actually predict your future.

(Michelle rolls her eyes.)

Erin: It's ridiculous, it's medieval.

Granda Joe: Shower of shites!

(Orangemen boo and bang on the car.)

Gerry: They really don't look that happy, do they?

Mary: (applying lipstick) Look, why don't we explain it was just an accident, that we don't want any trouble?

(Orangemen peer threateningly into the car.)

Gerry: I'm not going out there.

Mary: Well, send one of the wains out.

(James and Clare look horrified.)

Clare: What?

James: What?

Mary: Well, the wee fella's English. They might respect that.

Clare: I think they would respect that, actually!

(James looks panicked and betrayed.)

Gerry: Away you go, son.

James: You're not serious!

Gerry: It'll be grand. (panicking and smiling politely at passing Orangemen) Underneath it all, I'm sure they're reasonable enough people.

(Crowd of Orangemen boo and shake the car. James looks terrified.)

James: Absolutely no chance!

Michelle: (to Sarah) And how soon am I gonna meet this fella?

Sarah: Dead soon. Really soon.

Michelle: And answer me this. Is he a ride?

Sarah: Oh God, aye.

Michelle: Is it just a casual thing, or are we talking a keeper here?

Sarah: I'm thinking marriage.

Michelle: (looking excited) Holy fuck!

Erin: (bored) Catch yourself on.

Michelle: To think, I could be staring at him right now. (she peers out at the Orangemen surrounding her)

Erin: You can't marry an Orangeman, Michelle.

Michelle: That's a pity, cause I think there's something really sexy about the fact that they hate us so much.

(Orangemen continue to give them dirty looks. Orla and Michelle wave.)

[Time lapse. Outside the city, on the road to Portnoo.]

Gerry: I hope your father appreciates the fact that I was the one who got us out of that mess.

Mary: He won't! And nobody back there actually believed you were a Japanese tourist, Gerry. They all thought you were a nutcase. They took pity on you. (looking through her bag) No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Dear God, no.

Gerry: What's wrong?

Mary: I can't find my purse.

Gerry: I can see your purse right there.

Mary: Well no, that's my sterling purse! I'm talking about my punt purse. I can't find my punt purse, Gerry. (blesses herself) Blessed Saint Anthony, the grace of God has made you the patron saint of all things lost and stolen.

(James looks confused.)

Mary: I turn to you this day with childlike love and deep confidence.

(Clare is reading Moby Dick.)

Gerry: Look, Mary, calm down.

Mary: (angry and panicking) Calm down, Gerry?! We have no punts! We can't go to the Free State without punts. We're puntless. We haven't a punt between us. Oh God I think I think I'm having a panic attack. Oh, stupid punts.

Gerry: Over this? So what happened back there was totally fine, but this this is worth having a panic attack about?

Mary: No, you're gonna have to turn around.

Gerry: There is more chance of me eloping with your father to a flip flop shop in Hawaii-

Mary: Look, okay, fine! But that means we won't be able to buy anything, which means we'll have no food, which means we'll all starve to death. So, you know, on your head be it, Gerry. (realisation) Oh, actually, do you know what? I think I put it in the suitcase.

Gerry: (rolling his eyes) False alarm there, Saint Anthony. Sorry for troubling you.

(Both cars pull over to side of the road.)

Granda Joe: What's this prick up to now?

(They all get out.)

Granda Joe: (to Gerry) What the hell were you playing at back there, Kemosabe?

Gerry: That's actually a Native American term.

Granda Joe: Well, what were you meant to be?

Mary: Japanese.

James: I don't think you get much Japanese tourism in Derry, do you?

Michelle: Aye, cause that's why it wasn't believable, dickweed.

Erin: What's going on? Why have we stopped?

Mary: My punt purse is in the bucking suitcase.

Sarah: Punts are such a pain in the arse. Why can't they just use sterling?

Mary: Well they did for a while, Sarah, but then, you know, partition happened.

(Gerry opens the boot of the car.)

Gerry: (jumping back) Holy God!

(A man lies in their boot. He slowly sits up.)

Mary: Jesus Christ!

Orla: Did you not put him in there, Aunt Mary?

Mary: No. No, I did not.

Orla: All right? How's it going?

Emmett: Not too bad. Not too bad. And yourself?

(Orla smiles, shrugs and nods.)

Mary: I'm sorry, who are you?

Emmett: Ah, Emmett's the name. Well, not my real name, like, but it'll have to do. Anyway, I'll not be keeping you.

(Emmett starts to close the boot on himself again.)

Mary: No, hold on. Wait.

Emmett: (opening boot) Yeah?

(They all stare down on him.)

Mary: Do you mind telling us what you're doing in there?

Emmett: Aw, right. Well, during the last 24 hours, crossing the border has become somewhat of a priority for me. So, I did a bit of asking around, you know, just on the off chance someone would be heading down that way, and your name came up, and there you have it.

Gerry: (looking horrified) Fantastic.

(Orla nods happily.)

Emmett: All right? Lovely to meet you. (closes boot)

(Orla waves.)

[Time lapse.]

Michelle: I'm in shock.

Erin: It's insane.

Michelle: I don't even think I fancy him.

Erin: What?

Michelle: Well, it's obviously him. It's obviously my husband. Like it's just too much of a coincidence.

Erin: Do you remember the whole 'us being in grave danger' thing Sarah mentioned? Well, I think (hysterical) I think this might be it.

Michelle: I thought you said fortune telling was medieval.

Erin: Yeah, well, something has made me reassess all that. What was it again? Oh, aye. The fact that there's an actual Provo in the boot of our car!

Clare: (angry) Oh, no! I've lost my bookmark! Now I've lost my page! Oh my God! This day just goes from bad to worse!

Erin: Bit of perspective maybe, Clare.

Michelle: I could grow to fancy him, I suppose.

James: Why doesn't someone just call the police?

(They all stare at him like he's mad.)

Michelle: Cause that's not how things work around here, James.

James: (hysterical) Well, how do things work here? How do they work?! Will one of you please explain it to me? Because sometimes I feel like I've gone through the fucking looking glass!

Clare: Calm down, James.

Michelle: Aye, don't be such a dick, James.

(James tuts and shakes his head in frustration.)

(Mary knocks on the boot. Emmett opens up.)

Emmett: Was there something else, or?

Mary: Yes. Yes, there was something else, actually.

Emmett: I'm sure you have questions. I just don't really want to get into it all.

Mary: Yeah well, we didn't really want you to get into our boot.

Granda Joe: Maybe just leave the fella be, sure, what's the odds?

Gerry: What if they pull us over at the checkpoint, Joe? What if the army asks to search the car?

Granda Joe: The brits are flat out with thon parade. They'll not bother with the likes of us.

Emmett: That's a good point.

Mary: Stay out of it, you.

Granda Joe: Right, in you go, son. (closes the boot)

Mary: Ah, Da.

Granda Joe: What do you want me to do? Turf the wain out in the middle of nowhere?

Gerry: But this is dangerous, Joe. He is dangerous.

Emmett: (from inside the boot) I'm not dangerous.

Gerry: In fairness, Emmett, if you were dangerous, you wouldn't say that you were dangerous, would you?

Emmett: True.

Erin: (frantically) Shh!

(There's a ticking noise.)

Erin: Can you hear that?

Michelle: Hear what?

(James looks concerned.)

Gerry: Come on, Emmett, out you go. (starts opening boot)

Granda Joe: (stopping Gerry) Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah! You just stay where you are, son.

Erin: Ticking. It's It's It's like a ticking sound.

Gerry: I'm not comfortable driving him across the border.

Granda Joe: Fine. I'll drive him.

Erin: (turning towards the cars, looking terrified) Aw, dear God.

Mary: We're all involved in this, Da. We'll decide what to do as a family.

(Erin runs frantically towards her family beside the cars.)

Erin: Bomb! He has a bomb!

(Emmett suddenly opens the boot in panic.)

Erin: Listen, Mammy! Listen!

Mary: Ach, Erin, that's just the big clock.

(Emmett looks frustrated and relieved. He closes the boot again.)

[At Peggy's diner. The family sits at one table, Emmett sits at another, drinking coffee. They stare at him.]

Gerry: It's aiding and abetting. We're talking serious jail time here.

(Orla sleeps on Granda Joe's shoulder.)

Granda Joe: Well, it's a risk we have to take.

Gerry: No, it's not Joe. It's not a risk we have to take. It's a risk we shouldn't take.

Granda Joe: Don't you take that tone with me, boy.

Mary: He seems like a nice enough fella, Gerry.

Gerry: We have to walk away from this.

Erin: What if we can't walk away, Daddy? What if we don't help him and he kills us all because we know too much?

Orla: I like him. I think he's a character.

(The waitress walks over to take their order.)

Waitress: Well?

Gerry: Just a cup of tea for me, please, love.

(Mary smiles at the waitress.)

Mary: Same here.

Granda Joe: And here, thanks love.

Mary: Oh, and some Cokes for the wains, please. What do you fancy, Sarah?

Sarah: I wouldn't mind a wee vodka.

Michelle: Make that two.

Waitress: (annoyed) We don't sell alcohol.

(The baby cries and the waitress looks at her in annoyance.)

Sarah: I'll take a tea.

(Orla is sleeping on Granda Joe's shoulder again.)

Waitress: Any food?

Mary: (putting on her glasses) We're just looking.

Waitress: (sighs) Fine. (walks away)

Gerry: Yeah, and at 2.25 a burger, looking is all we'll be doing.

(Emmett suddenly appears at their table. They look shocked. He grabs a knife.)

Emmett: Ah, don't mind me. Just grabbing a knife.

(Everyone looks uncomfortable.)

Emmett: Take it you haven't decided yet.

Granda Joe: Just leave it with me, son.

Emmett: Aye, no pressure. Sure I'll be over here if you need me.

(Emmett returns to his table.)

Erin: What the hell does he need a knife for?

James: He's eating his lunch.

(Emmett uncomfortably pulls food from his teeth. Sarah and Michelle stare at him.)

Sarah: God, but he has great teeth, doesn't he?

Michelle: (in awe) He really does, but Now, tell the truth. The hair. Can you see a ginger tinge?

Sarah: Now that you mention it

Michelle: So Christ only knows what's lurking downstairs. And that is a concern.

Erin: But spending the rest of your life with a fugitive is less of a concern?

Michelle: Absolutely. (she gazes at him flirtatiously)

(Michelle approaches Emmett's table.)

Michelle: Hey.

Emmett: All right?

Michelle: (sits down) I think you know who I am.

Emmett: Yeah.

Michelle: You sense it?

Emmett: No, I mean I remember. You're with them. (points at the family)

Michelle: Look, I just wanted to say, while there's obviously something between us

Emmett: (confused) There is?

Michelle: The physical thing isn't really working for me yet.

Emmett: Right.

Michelle: I'm not saying you won't grow on me. You're not a bad looking lad.

Emmett: Thank you.

Michelle: But the ginger element Well, I've sort of got a borderline phobia.

Emmett: I'm not ginger.

Michelle: There's a tinge, Emmett.

(Emmett looks deeply confused.)

Michelle: And while I can't say it won't be a struggle, I'm willing to try.

Emmett: (drinking tea) Great.

Michelle: (smiling) Even though it sort of turns my stomach. (giggles)

Emmett: Okay.

(At the other table, Sarah takes out her tarot cards.)

Mary: Do you really think this will work? That they'll tell us what to do?

Sarah: Sure it's worth a try. (gasps) Would you look at that?

Mary: What? What do they say?

Sarah: I think Now I can't be certain, but I think they're saying you should leave Gerry.

(Mary stares at Gerry. Gerry looks worried.)

Granda Joe: I could have told you that years ago, and I'm not psychic.

Gerry: (sighs) Okay. Look, I've yet to hear anybody say anything to convince me that bringing that lad across the border with us is a good idea.

(Emmett walks towards the table.)

Erin: Shit, he's coming.

Emmett: I really didn't want to have to do this. (he reaches into his pocket)

Erin: Jesus Christ! Get down! Everybody get down! (She jumps under the table.)

(The others sit awkwardly.)

Emmett: (holding a packet of cigarettes) Is there something wrong with her?

Mary: Stop that, Erin.

(Emmett lights up a cigarette. Erin crawls out from under the table.)

Erin: Sorry Emmett, you were saying?

Emmett: Didn't want to put you in this position, but I can't stress the seriousness of my situation.

(Waitress walks up.)

Waitress: Anything else?

Emmett: Oh, do you know what? I wouldn't mind a knickerbocker glory.

Waitress: (glaring at Emmett) Right. (she walks away)

Emmett: You need to help me out here.

Gerry: We do that and we're breaking the law.

Emmett: Oh you recognise the legal system of a brutal, imperialistic oppressor, do you?

Gerry: Uh, if they can put me in jail for twenty years, then yes Emmett. Yes, I do.

Granda Joe: Listen, listen. Have you killed anyone, son?

Emmett: No. (looking uncertain) Well, at least not directly?

Granda Joe: Well, there you go. So that settles it.

(Gerry looks appalled.)

Gerry: I don't think that does settle it actually, Joe!

Granda Joe: You know what's wrong with you, Gerry? You're an awful wuss.

Gerry: I'm not a wuss!

Granda Joe: You're afraid of your own shadow.

Gerry: (angry) No, I'm not.

Granda Joe: Then grow a set of balls and help the fella out.

Gerry: I have a set of balls, thank you very much.

Erin: Oh seriously, Daddy.

Granda Joe: You're even afraid of that wee girl.

Gerry: What wee girl?

Granda Joe: That waitress.

(Gerry looks shocked.)

Granda Joe: You wanted a cup of tea, she brought you a coke, and you just sat there and said sweet Fanny Adams.

Michelle: (laughs) Your granda said fanny.

Gerry: Well, that's because I like coke!

Emmett: Her customer service is shocking as well.

Mary: Aye, desperate.

Sarah: Someone should say something.

Granda Joe: (pointing at Gerry) Aye! Gerry! Gerry should say something!

Gerry: I will. No problem. I'll say something.

(They all look uncertain.)

Gerry: (to waitress) Excuse me! Excuse me, please. (nods at waitress)

(The waitress walks over.)

Waitress: (snaps) What?

Gerry: Um, I just wanted to say that, uh, I, um, I ordered a tea, you brought me a coke, and that's not acceptable.

Waitress: But you drank the coke.

Gerry: That's not the point.

(Granda Joe nods at him.)

Gerry: And your service has been nothing short of appalling. Your attitude is worse. It's simply not good enough!

Waitress: (looking upset) I'll, uh I'll bring you a tea.

Gerry: (snapping) You do that!

(Waitress starts to cry.)

Waitress: I'm sorry. I got a bit of bad news today. I haven't really been able to focus on I've been a bit distracted maybe.

(Gerry looks guilty.)

Waitress: I'm sorry. I'll just- (she goes to grab the glasses)

Gerry: No, no, no. Ignore all that.

Waitress: (still sobbing) I'll bring you your tea right away, sir. (she walks away quickly)

Granda Joe: (sternly) Well, there was absolutely no need for that.

(Everyone looks at Gerry in shock.)

Sarah: Jesus, Gerry.

Michelle: (nodding) Harsh.

Emmett: Awful.

Clare: Poor girl.

Erin: Aye, I can't believe you did that, Daddy.

Gerry: (looking annoyed) I (to Joe) You asked me to. How could I have known?

(The group look dissatisfied.)

Gerry: Now, will you all just stop looking at me?

(They continue looking at him.)

Gerry: Fine. Fine. Do you know what? Fine! I've had it with the lot of you! (he gets up) And, just for the record back there, I was being an Australian tourist, okay? Australian. And I happen to think that my accent was flawless. (in an Australian accent) Excuse me, mate. Can you help us get out of here? (back to Irish) Flawless! (he walks away)

Mary: (looking shocked) Okay. We have to decide what to do here, one way or another. Let's just vote.

Erin: Leave him! (lowers voice to Mary) I vote we run away and leave him.

Michelle: I vote we take him, for better or worse and all that.

(Emmett nods in appreciation.)

Granda Joe: I vote we take him.

Orla: Me too.

Clare: I can't decide.

James: I've decided, but I'm afraid to say what I've decided.

Sarah: Why don't we just toss a coin?

[In the bathroom. Gerry splashes water across his face.]

(Gerry looks in the mirror while drying his face, only to see the rifles that were painted on his house wall, on the wall behind him. He turns around in shock.)

(He walks over, and touches it. It is still wet.)

Gerry: Interesting.

[At the table. Mary has her purse out, rummaging for change.]

Sarah: So, heads, the wee RA man comes with us. Tails, we leave him.

Granda Joe: (nodding) Mmm.

Mary: (holding the coin) Aye. Ready?

Granda Joe: Go on, then.

(Mary throws the coin on the table. It clatters. They all wait. It settles.)

James: What is that? A fish?

Sarah: A dolphin, is it?

Clare: It sort of looks like Moby Dick, actually.

Mary: Ah, shite. I used a punt, didn't I?

Michelle: Well, what's on the other side?

Granda Joe: A harp.

Erin: So, harp must be the head and fish must be the tail?

(Emmett walks away.)

Orla: Oh, that makes sense yeah, because fish have tails. (she laughs)

Sarah: Why don't we just do it again with real money?

Mary: This is real money, Sarah.

Sarah: You know what I mean. Normal money.

Mary: (frustrated) All right! Who has ten pence?

Gerry: (back from the bathroom) It was him!

(Everyone turns to look at him.)

Gerry: The mural on our house, the spray paint. It was Emmett, and I can prove it.

Mary: (shocked) Sly wee bastard!

Granda Joe: You bloody tout.

Sarah: Where is Emmett?

Orla: (pointing out the window) There he is.

(They all walk over to the window. Emmett stands with Jim's second-best tent.)

Mary: Is that Jim's tent?

(James sighs in frustration.)

Clare: What's he doing?

(Emmett moves after a moving car, jumps in the boot and slams it behind him.)

Granda Joe: (furiously turning to Gerry) I told you to look after that tent.

Gerry: No you didn't, you told him to look after it. (pointing at James)

Granda Joe: Ah! Blame the wain, big man. (he dramatically turns to the window again) Jesus. Jim's second-best tent. How am I going to break it to him?

EPISODE 6

[In the Quinn kitchen.]

Mary: All I'm saying is I find it difficult to believe.

Sarah: But it's the truth, Mary.

Mary: Really?

Sarah: Honest to God.

Mary: So if I was to go next door and open that washing basket of yours

Sarah: You wouldn't find any darks. What, do you think I'm holding out on you?

Mary: I don't know what to believe.

Sarah: Listen, I've plenty of coloureds. You're welcome to my coloureds.

Mary: I'm not interested in your coloureds, Sarah. It's darks I need.

(Granda Joe walks in.)

Mary: Oh listen, Da.

Granda Joe: Do not be starting me about darks, Mary. I've given you whatever darks I have. (puts on a hat) Stick on a half load and be done with it, woman.


Mary: A half load goes against everything I stand for. You know that, Da.

Sarah: You away to do the big shop, Da?

Granda Joe: Aye. Gerry!

(Mary is startled by Joe shouting.)

Granda Joe: Gerry! I don't see why that useless drip you call a husband has to get coming.

Mary: Because someone needs to drive, and you've been suspended, again.

Sarah: What did you do this time, Daddy?

Granda Joe: Nothing. It's RUC discrimination. The only crime I committed was to be born a Catholic.

Mary: Gerry's never been suspended, and he's a Catholic.

Granda Joe: He's also a prick, but that's by the by.

Mary: Cut that out, Da.

(Gerry walks in.)

Gerry: Found some.

Mary: (looking excited and thankful) Oh!

Gerry: Found some, Mary!

(Mary's face drops as she sees Gerry holding a pair of socks. She takes the socks.)

Mary: Great.

Granda Joe: Right. That's us away.

Mary: (to Gerry) Have a nice time.

Granda Joe: (walking out) Tell that Free State fucker to shift his hole!

Gerry: (looking annoyed) I'm sure we will. (follows Joe)

(Mary looks disappointed.)

Sarah: There's no shame in doing a half load, you know, Mary.

Mary: I can't, Sarah. I physically can't.

(Erin, Orla, Clare, Michelle and James walk in, wearing their uniforms and chattering. Mary eyes up their dark blazers excitedly.)

[Time lapse. The kids are washing dishes and wearing nothing but their shirts, underwear, socks and shoes.]

Mary: (to James) Hey. Let me look at that.

(James walks over holding a plate.)

Mary: And you call that clean, do you?

Sarah: Different standards, you see, Mary. You're not in England now, son.

James: Orla was the one who washed it.

Orla: (sarcastically laughing) Oh, okay. Okay, I have had it with you, James, and your picking, picking, picking, and I won't take it anymore. Do you hear me?

James: Is everything okay, Orla?

Sarah: I warned you, Orla. You're putting yourself under too much pressure.

Orla: Can't fail, Mammy.

Erin: Since when have you been troubled by exams?

Orla: (confused) Exams? What are you on about, Erin?

Erin: What are you on about, Orla?

Orla: Step.

Erin: I'm sorry?

Orla: Step aerobics!

Sarah: Orla's got really into step aerobics. Her instructor says she's a natural.

(Orla smiles at Sarah.)

Sarah: Says she's got what it takes to go all the way.

Mary: All the way in step aerobics?

Sarah: But it's out of control now, Mary. She's stepping morning, noon and night. Apart from anything else, it's dangerous. She nearly came through the ceiling yesterday. Okay, she might be gifted, but I just want her to have a normal childhood.

Orla: I won't give it up. I can't.

Sarah: Listen to yourself, love.

(Mary grabs her basket and stares eagerly at the kids.)

Mary: Now, whites.

(The kids look scared and Mary returns a stern look.)

[At the market. Joe is pushing a trolley and sees Gerry in a photo shop. He stops and pushes his trolley inside.]

Granda Joe: I've got my eye on you, boy.

(Gerry turns, startled.)

Gerry: Jesus, Joe.

Granda Joe: What are you doing here? Meeting your fancy woman, I suppose.

Gerry: No, I'm not. I'm collecting Mary's photographs. And if I was having an illicit rendezvous with my mistress, I'm not sure that the supermarket that my father-in-law is doing the big shop in would be the best place for it, really.

(Ciaran, who works in the photo shop appears with Mary's photos in hand.)

Ciaran: 'Quinn', you said?

Gerry: That's right.

Ciaran: Here we go.

Gerry: Great.

Ciaran: That'll be 3.75, please. And have you got your wee docket there?

Gerry: Yeah, I do, yeah. (searches through wallet)

Ciaran: It's a wee, red slip of paper, about yea big. (shows size with hands)

Gerry: Yeah.

Ciaran: Dark blue lettering, it has.

Gerry: Yeah, I know.

Ciaran: Not a navy blue, more like a royal blue.

Gerry: I know what it looks like.

Ciaran: Times new roman, I believe the font is called.

Gerry: (frantically searching) I just can't find it.

Granda Joe: Prick.

Gerry: Uh, look, I'm sorry. Um, do you absolutely need it?

Ciaran: I'm afraid I do, sir, yes. Proof of ID.

Gerry: But you have my surname written on it, there.

Ciaran: How do I know that's your surname?

Gerry: Because I just told you it was my surname.

Ciaran: You could be lying.

Gerry: And why would I lie?

Ciaran: To get your hands on someone else's photos.

Gerry: And why would I want somebody else's photos? Like who would pay for somebody's else's photos?

Granda Joe: Ah, stalker maybe.

Ciaran: Yeah, exactly! Very good, sir. A stalker. (points at Gerry)

Gerry: I'm not a stalker!

Ciaran: Look, why don't you just go home and have a wee look for your wee docket? (smiles)

Gerry: No, this is ridiculous. Just open that up and take out one of the photos.

(Ciaran sighs and opens the packet of photos. He takes one out.)

Gerry: You see? That's me wife, there.

Ciaran: How do I know you're not just telling me that?

Gerry: Because that's me, standing beside her.

Ciaran: (staring at photo) I suppose you do look a bit like this man.

Gerry: I am this man.

(Ciaran closes compares the two.)

Ciaran: It could be you.

Gerry: It's definitely me. My name is Gerry Quinn. This is my father-in-law, Joe. He can vouch for me.

(Ciaran looks at Joe expectantly.)

Granda Joe: I've never seen this man before in my life.

(Gerry looks shocked and annoyed.)

Ciaran: No docket, no photographs. (he walks away with the photos)

(Gerry shakes his head at Joe. Joe shrugs.)

[At the school, in the library. Jenny and her friends work hard, Erin stands over the copier.]

Aisling: (to Erin) Ten copies of these, please. And Jenny wants a tea.

(Erin smiles fakely and doesn't move.)

(Jenny stands on a chair.)

Jenny: Okay, guys. Don't forget, entries for our 'searching for myself' writing competition are to be placed here. (points at a colourful box) If you could all spread the word, that'd be fabby-dabby-doo.

Erin: (to herself) Fabby-dabby-dick.

(Sister Michael walks in.)

Sister Michael: Can I have your attention, please, ladies? (to Jenny) Get down, get down.

(All the girls gather round.)

Sister Michael: I've just received a phone call from Louise Kerr's mother, and it's not looking great.

Jenny: (distraught) Oh, God. I just can't believe it.

Sister Michael: It's unlikely she'll be returning to school before the end of the year, so I think the only thing we can do now is-

Aisling: Pray for her?

Sister Michael: (sneering) No, sure what use would that do? No, I think the best thing we can do is decide who will fulfil the role of editor now.

Jenny: (raising her hand) Sister Michael, some of us have actually already discussed this eventuality, and the thing is, well, nobody's comfortable stepping into Louise's shoes.

Aisling: It feels a bit, sort of disrespectful.

Jenny: We think this issue should be cancelled.

Sister Michael: Right, well fair enough. If nobody's willing to take her place-

Erin: (raising her hand) I'll do it.

Jenny: (appalled) Excuse me?

Erin: I'll take her place. I'll step into her shoes. I'll do it.

Sister Michael: Really?

Erin: Absolutely.

Jenny: No, you can't. We are making a statement. You're ruining our statement.

(The other girls look annoyed at Erin.)

Erin: Look, girls, I know Louise meant a lot to you all.

Jenny: She's not dead, Erin!

Erin: Well, not yet. And hopefully she won't, you know, die.

(Aisling looks shocked. Jenny looks taken aback.)

Erin: But if she does, the show must go on. (enthusiastically) Isn't that right, Sister Michael?

Sister Michael: You terrify me.

Jenny: You can't be the editor.

Aisling: You've never even written an article, Erin.

Erin: That's because I can't get anything past Rupert Murdoch over there. (gestures towards Jenny)

Jenny: This isn't fair. You can't let it happen, Sister.

Sister Michael: (nods) I know. But I'm bored now, so it looks like I probably will. Good luck, all. (walks away)

(Erin looks shocked and elated.)

[In the Quinn living room. They all search through the drawers.]

Mary: How could you have lost the wee docket, Gerry?

(In the background Orla enthusiastically practices her step aerobics.)

Sarah:  Aye, everybody knows you have to hang onto the wee docket.

Gerry: Look, I've said that I'm sorry!

Mary: There were my birthday photos, for God's sake.

Granda Joe: There's definitely grounds for an annulment here, Mary.

Mary: I mean, you only turn thirty-three once.

Gerry: You've been thirty-three a few times now, in fairness, Mary.

Mary: Well aren't you a brave man, given the circumstances?

Granda Joe: Mary, come on. Would you not reconsider?

(Gerry looks scared.)

Mary: No, Da.

Granda Joe: Please, love. Just the once.

Mary: I'm not letting you hit him, Da.

Sarah: I'm devastated. That was when I lost the half stone doing the Rosemary Conley, as well. My collar bone was sort of poking through my skin. Do you remember, Mary?

Mary: Aye, you were far too thin, Sarah.

Sarah: I know I was. It was brilliant. And now I haven't got so much as a photograph to look back on.

Gerry: Look, it's gone. The docket's gone. Why don't we just move on?

Granda Joe: Why don't you just move out?

(Erin walks in excitedly.)

Erin: Guess who's been made editor of the school magazine!

(No one pays attention. The washing machine beeps and Mary runs to it.)

Erin: (ecstatic) Me! I have! Can you believe it?

Mary: Oh, Christ. My whites.

(Mary walks out with newly pink clothes.)

Mary: I think I know what happened to the wee docket. (she holds it up)

(Gerry looks guilty. They stare at him.)

[In the school corridor.]

(Erin walks confidently in slow motion wearing a pink shirt. People give her odd looks.)

(James, Clare, Michelle and Orla appear, also wearing pink shirts. Erin ignores them and walks on.)

Michelle: Dick.

(Orla looks at Clare questioningly. Clare shrugs it off. They walk in opposite direction.)

[In the library at school. Erin walks in.]

Erin: Good morning, team!

(The room appears to be empty.)

Erin: (looking deflated) Where is everyone?

Aisling: (appearing from behind a computer) They quit.

Erin: What? You're not serious.

Aisling: They all think what you did was pretty out of order, Erin.

Erin: I see.

Aisling: And that you're a bit ruthless.

Erin: Okay.

Aisling: And cold.

Erin: Right.

Aisling: And nobody really has any respect for you.

Erin: Yes, all right! Thank you. (takes a breath) Well, I appreciate that you're still here, Aisling. I really do. I'm not gonna lie. Just the two of us, it's gonna be tough, but if you're not afraid of the challenge (drops briefcase) then neither am I.

Aisling: (looking awkward) Yeah. I only came back because I forgot my inhaler. (holds up inhaler)

Erin: Fine. Puff off!

(Aisling starts to walk out of the library, puffing on her inhaler.)

Erin: I don't need you. I don't need any of you. I've got my own people, and we'll show you up for the amateurs that you are. (shouting after Aisling down the corridor) My people are shit hot! Do you hear me? Shit hot!

[Time lapse. Michelle, James, Clare and Orla have joined Erin in the library.]

(Michelle is casually smoking.)

James: Okay. Right.

(James is working on a computer. Orla is doing step aerobics. Clare is looking at the copier. Erin is writing on the board.)

James: Okay. How do I do a new line again?

Michelle: Return. Jesus, James. How many times?

James: Return.

Clare: I can't understand!

(The copier beeps. Clare kicks it.)

Clare: Come on!

Erin: (turning suddenly) Seriously? Will you be quiet? I am trying to get my creative juices flowing over here!

(Clare looks distraught.)

Michelle: Okay, you're going to have to never say that sentence again.

Erin: Enough! Come on. We need to make a call on our lead story.

(Orla leaps towards her. The others gather round.)

Erin: Okay. So, let's

(Orla keeps working on her moves. Erin turns towards her.)

Erin: Would you stop doing that, please?

Orla: I can't let my heartrate drop, I'm afraid, Erin.

Erin: Let's just run through some of our favourite ideas. So, firstly, animals.

(Clare does not look convinced.)

James: Animals. Can someone elaborate?

Erin: Yeah. So, this concept would focus on animals, alongside pictures of famous people who look a bit like animals.

Orla: (stretching) Michelle Pfeiffer looks like a cat.

Erin: Exactly.

James: Okay. Right. Animals.

(Clare folds her arms stressfully.)

James: Uh, what's the next one? Shoes of the-

Erin: Shoes of the world.

James: And that involves?

Erin: So, this piece would concentrate on different shoes from around the world, sitting alongside pictures of you know, different shoes from around the world.

James: (nods with worry) Okay.

Erin: So, like, how in Russia they wear boots because-

Michelle: It's Baltic.

Erin: And in India they wear sandals because-

Michelle: It's boiling.

(Erin nods confidently. James looks concerned.)

James: So, that's it, is it?

Erin: Thoughts?

James: I'm not totally convinced by either of them, if I'm honest.

Erin: (turning to face the board) Oh, my God, they're shit. They're absolutely shit. How can we print this utter shit?

James: (patting Erin on the shoulder) Okay, don't panic.

Erin: Don't panic? (panicking) Don't panic, James? 'Shoes of the world.' What does that even mean?

Michelle: Yeah, we're fucked.

Erin: No.

(Clare nods in distress.)

Erin: It's okay. It's gonna be okay. We-we-we just need to change our approach slightly. (she opens the box for the writing competition)

(Orla continues with her step aerobics.)

Clare: The writing competition?

Erin: (turning to face Clare with some sheets of paper) Exactly. There's bound to be something in here we can steal. We can just steal something, and we'll-we'll just steal someone's idea and we'll pass it off as our own. (hands a sheet to Clare)

James: Journalistic integrity at its finest.

Michelle: 'Searching for Myself'. What a load of balls.

Erin: (takes a sheet of paper) Oh my God.

Michelle: Let's see. (she looks at the sheet) 'Suffocation: The Secret Life of a Gay Teenager'. (she scoffs)

Erin: It's anonymous.

(Orla points at James.)

James: (offended) It wasn't me.

Erin: No. This was written by a girl. A real-life lesbian walks among us.

Orla: (looking confused) I don't really believe in lesbians.

Erin: This is perfect! We'll just print this.

Clare: Come on, Erin. You can't do that.

Erin: Why not?

Clare: We'll get in trouble, real trouble, big trouble.

Erin: You're not afraid of a bit of controversy, are you?

Clare: Yes! Actually, yes, I am! Something like this could go on our permanent record, Erin.

Erin: And what's more important, Clare? Your permanent record, or telling this poor girl's story?

Clare: My permanent record! (fires paper on the floor) Count me out! (she storms out of the library)

(Orla waves.)

Erin: (shouting) Fine! Well this issue of The Habit will go down in history! In history, I say!

(Orla looks excited.)

Michelle: You seriously need to chill the fuck out.

[In Sister Michael's office. A copy of The Habit is placed on her desk, with the headline 'THE SECRET LIFE OF A LESBIAN!' written on the front.]

Sister Michael: Not happening.

Erin: But Sister Michael-

Sister Michael: Don't even think about arguing. I can't be doing with the board of governors getting wind of something like this at the moment. They're a thorn in my arse at the best of times. I mean, for God's sake, Erin, what happened to 'Shoes of the World'?

Erin: This is more important. This is about, you know, gay rights.

Sister Michael: (rolling her eyes) I see. And I take it that's what the camp shirts are in aid of. A very serious uniform violation, by the way. But let's take one problem at a time, shall we?

Erin: (looking offended) This isn't a problem, Sister. (pointing at the newspaper) This is groundbreaking journalism.

Sister Michael: (sternly) They are not to be distributed tomorrow. Do I make myself clear?

James: But that's censorship.

Sister Michael: Well done. You are correct. You're being censored. Now go.

(James, Michelle and Orla walk away, annoyed. Erin doesn't move.)

[At the market.]

(Sarah tries out a perfume sample.)

[In the photo shop.]

Granda Joe: You see, I was so focused on pissing off that gobshite my eldest girl's unfortunate enough to be married to, that I completely lost sight of the fact that they were really her birthday photos.

(Ciaran nods.)

Granda Joe: And my other girl, my younger girl, well, she was looking very slim at the time, so

(Ciaran smiles.)

Granda Joe: Go and grab them for me, there's a good fella. (passes the wet docket to Ciaran)

Ciaran: I can't accept that.

Granda Joe: I think something's been lost in translation here, boy.

(Ciaran looks concerned. Sarah walks in with perfume.)

Sarah: Here, Daddy. Get a whiff of that. (she puts her wrist to his nose)

(Joe sniffs.)

Granda Joe: Oh, that's very nice, love.

Ciaran: (amazed) It's you.

(Sarah sprays perfume all over herself and looks at Ciaran.)

Sarah: What?

Ciaran: The photographs. Well I remember you. Oh, I couldn't forget you. Hope you don't mind me saying this, but you have a cracking clavicle.

Sarah: (looking pleasantly surprised) I don't mind, Ciaran. I don't mind, at all.

(Ciaran smiles.)

Granda Joe: Oh, for Christ's sake.

[In the Quinn kitchen. They're eating dinner.]

Erin: It's wrong. I mean, my God, the injustice of it all.

(Sarah and Ciaran are looking at a photo.)

Sarah: You should get that one framed as a wee reminder of your night, Mary.

Mary: I'm not in that one.

Sarah: I know, but it's stunning of me.

Ciaran: (touching her hand) It is indeed.

Granda Joe: Hey, boy. It's dinner she invited you round for, not an orgy.

(Ciaran looks awkward and pulls his hand away.)

Erin: She basically told us we can't print the story because it's about a lesbian.

Sarah: Do you not think there's an awful lot of lesbians about nowadays? You can't move for lesbians. It's wall-to-wall lesbians out there.

Gerry: Really?

Granda Joe: Oh, it's true. Brigitte Gallagher, she's a lesbian.

(Orla does step aerobics in the background.)

Mary: (shocked) Brigette Gallagher, who works in the post office?

Granda Joe: I believe so.

Sarah: Is she not a vegetarian, Da?

Granda Joe: Sorry, you're right. (nods) Vegetarian, Brigitte is.

(Mary looks relieved.)

Ciaran: (smiling) Well, it's an easy mistake to make, Joe. Can I call you Joe?

Granda Joe: No.

Ciaran: (smiling awkwardly) Right.

Gerry: Welcome to the club, Ciaran.

Erin: I'm gonna have to make a stand about this, Mammy.

Mary: Ah, no you won't, Erin.

Erin: The school is trying to erase this young girl's experience, all because she's gay. I mean, what if it were me? What if it were Orla?

(Orla continues doing step aerobics.)

Mary: Fine. Stick up for the wee lesbian.

Orla: I just don't understand what they eat.

[Outside the school.]

(Erin, Michelle, James and Orla are handing out newspapers to kids getting off the bus.)

Michelle: (handing someone a newspaper) Read all about the wee dyke.

Erin: (throwing her arms in the air) We will not be censored!

Orla: (holding newspapers in both arms) Lesbians really do exist!

James: (holding up newspapers) I support gays, even though I, myself, am not actually gay!

Erin: (walking up to Clare) Awk, come on, Clare.

Clare: I don't want to get involved. I'm sorry. (walks away)

Erin: Coward!

[Inside the school. Everyone is reading the newspaper.]

(Jenny looks horrified.)

Sister Michael: (to Jenny) What's going on?

Jenny: (smugly) Erin Quinn and her friends are handing out their magazine. They're ignoring the ban, Sister. You need to put a stop to it.

(Sister Michael pauses, nods and walks away.)

Jenny: Sister, didn't you hear me?

Sister Michael: Do you know what, Jenny? I don't think I did. (takes a newspaper)

[Time lapse. James is getting a drink from the vending machine.]

Michelle: Isn't this mad?

James: (shaking his head in disbelief) It's all anyone's talking about.

Michelle: Everyone's buzzing to find out who she is.

James: Well, if she ever does reveal herself, she'll basically be a celebrity.

Michelle: Excuse me. Excuse me, everybody! Excuse me. (she runs half-way up the stairs) Excuse me! Yep! (clears her throat)

(James watches her with dread.)

Michelle: I just wanna say, that if you're looking for the wee lezzer, look no further, because here she is.

(James looks embarrassed.)

Michelle: Love women. Can't get enough of the ladies. Big fan of the fandango. Huge. Massive.

Girl 1: Aye, so's me ma.

Girl 2: Aye, good one.

Girl 3: You're talking shite.

Michelle: (annoyed) Fuck off.

[In the library at the school. Erin sits at a desk. Clare walks over to her.]

Clare: Hi.

Erin: Oh, it's crawled out from under its rock, has it? You should be ashamed of yourself.

Clare: I know. I'm sorry. It all just made me a bit nervous.

Erin: Everything makes you nervous, Clare. You're a walking cack attack.

Clare: I can't help that. It's the way God made me.

Erin: Michelle's running round saying it's her, that she wrote the story, that she's the wee lesbian. As if, like. There'd be more chance of it being you.

Clare: It is me.

Erin: No, I mean, I'd be less surprised if it was you.

Clare: It is.

Erin: No, it's not, but if it was-

Clare: Erin! It's me. I'm the wee lesbian. (she looks nervous)

Erin: Aye, so you are, Clare.

Clare: I'm not joking.

Erin: (shocked) You're You're a lesbian?

Clare: (smiling) I've never been brave enough to say it out loud before, but I think that's why I wrote the story, and then it all got too real. I got too scared, but now, well you made me realise it's all okay.

Erin: Don't blame me.

Clare: (her face drops) What?

Erin: You fancy girls?

Clare: Well, that's sort of an entry-level requirement, Erin.

Erin: I think I'm gonna boke.

Clare: Do you mind? I'm trying to come out here.

Erin: Well don't. Don't come out. Go back in.

Clare: I don't wanna go back in.

Erin: Well, I'm sorry, Clare, but I'm just not interested in you, not like that.

Clare: (angry) I'm not interested in you like that. Look at the state of you.

Erin: Oh, come off it!

Clare: Your arrogance is staggering, Erin.

Erin: Well, you know what else is staggering? Your gayness!

Clare: (looking upset) I really thought you'd understand.

[In the corridor. A girl puts up a poster for a talent show. Orla gazes at it interestedly.]

[In the Quinn kitchen.]

Erin: She won't even talk to me. She doesn't even want to sit beside me. In French, she moved next to Caoimhe Callaghan, so things must be bad, because Caoimhe reeks of piss.

Granda Joe: (gesturing towards Ciaran) Oh, for Christ's sakes. Is this bastard living with us now?

Sarah: (smoking) Daddy's dead funny, isn't he?

Ciaran: (awkwardly) Yeah.

Erin: I just want my old friend back.

Gerry: (putting his arm around Erin) She hasn't gone anywhere, love.

(Orla suddenly falls over in the background.)

[In the assembly hall at school.]

(Clare stands alone. She looks around sadly.)

(Erin, Michelle and James walk in. Erin waves at Clare. Clare ignores her and sits down.)

James: Can you blame her?

Michelle: Ignore him, Erin. These gays, they all stick together.

James: (annoyed) I'm not gay. 

(James pushes past Michelle and makes his way to sit with Clare.)

Michelle: What's wrong with being gay? He is such a fucking homophobe.

(Erin and Michelle walk towards other seats away from Clare and James.)

[Time lapse. Jenny is singing out of tune on stage.]

Jenny: (singing) It's the heart, afraid of breaking, that never learns to dance.

(Erin looks sadly towards Clare and James. James glances at her and she looks away.)

Erin: Now James isn't even speaking to me.

Michelle: Don't worry about James. James doesn't count.

(Erin looks sadly at Clare. Clare looks back.)

Jenny: (singing) Afraid of waking, that never takes the chance. (grabs mic dramatically)

(Aisling begins singing while playing piano.)

Jenny and Aisling: It's the ones, who won't be taken, who cannot seem to give, and the soul, afraid of dying, that never learns to live.

(Erin still looks miserable.)

(Light applause. Jenny and Aisling bow on stage, then walk away.)

Sister Michael: Lovely altogether. 

(Sister Michael walks towards the mic, rolling her eyes.)

Sister Michael: You know, every year, I sit backstage listening to the singers and it really makes me realise just how talented the professionals who originally recorded these tracks were. (walks away from mic) Now, who's on next?

[Time lapse. Four girls are Irish dancing on stage.]

(Sister Michael rolls her eyes. Everyone looks bored. They finish.)

Sister Michael: Christ, this is penance.

(Sister Michael walks towards the mic again.)

Sister Michael: I'm not doing it again. I mean it this time. (looks at paper) Up next we have Orla McCool. (walks away)

(Clare looks at James. James looks shocked. They exchange a concerned look. Orla walks onstage.)

Erin: (to Michelle) Christ.

(Music starts playing and Orla looks dramatic as the song builds up. She begins her step aerobics.)

(Mandy and Tina laugh. Other girls exchange amused glances.)

(Orla continues with her step aerobics, oblivious to the audience's reactions.)

(More people laugh, until eventually everyone's laughing except Michelle, Erin, James and Clare.)

Mandy: (to Tina) What's wrong with her, like?

Tina: She's such a dick.

(Clare looks furious.)

(Erin furiously whacks Tina on the shoulder. Tina turns to face her.)

Erin: Yeah, she might be a dick. (stands up and shouts) But she's my dick!

Clare: (standing up and shouting) Actually, she's our dick!

(Erin and Clare smile at each other emotionally. They nod and walk towards each other.)

(James looks anxious.)

Michelle: (standing up) Oh, for fuck's sake.

(Erin, Clare, James and Michelle all walk up onto the stage. Orla looks happy as they dance along with her moves.)

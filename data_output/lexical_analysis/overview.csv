1. Clare: Erin, you really think you should wear *that* to a boy’s party?

2. Erin: Better than looking like a blowfish, Clare. (frowns at her dress in the mirror)

3. James: (from the doorway) Confidence, Erin! Be bold like a hawk, not stiff like a blowfish.

4. Orla: Ew, James. Nobody wants to be a blowfish.

5. Erin: I’m not sure I want to go, though. A boy’s party sounds… weird.

6. Michelle: Weird? Erin, boy’s party = opportunity. Opportunity to be *sexy*. (strikes a pose)

7. Erin: Sexy? Mum, I’m thirteen. If I try to be sexy, I'll look ridiculous.

8. Michelle: Ridiculous sells, sweetheart. Sometimes ridiculous is the look.

9. Clare: Look, just be yourself. Unless you’re a blowfish. Then pick a look.

10. Orla: And if you're going to be sexy, wear red. Red distracts the eye from bad dancing.

11. James: (rolls his eyes) Are we styling Erin or sending her to battle?

12. Erin: I just don’t want to regret it later. What if I spill something everywhere?

13. Michelle: Spill? Then you’ll clean it up, or someone else will.

14. Jon: (knocks and enters) Hey, girls. You're all ready?

15. Erin: I think so. Or I’m somewhere between sexy and sensible.

16. Jon: That’s perfect. No one notices sensible anyway, Erin. Go with the sexy.

17. James: See? Jon gets it. Confidence, eye contact, smile. Not blowfish.

18. Erin: (sighs) Fine. Eye contact. Smile. And maybe red lips.

19. Orla: Don’t let any boys see your diary tonight either. That’s reserved for your enemies.

20. Clare: Enemy? Who needs enemies when you’ve got siblings?

21. James: Erin, promise me one thing—you’ll dance even if it feels silly.

22. Erin: Promise. (takes a deep breath, fixes her dress) Let’s go make a memory, not a mannequin.

Erin: I'm not sure about this.

Michelle: I knew you'd fanny out!

Erin: These lads have moves. You said so yourself, Michelle. And I haven't got any moves!

(They walk up the stairs.)

Michelle: Look, let's just get in there, have a few drinks, and just loosen up a bit.

Clare: No! No loosening up! I don't like it!

James: Just be confident, Erin. Boys like that.

Michelle: How the fuck would you know what boys like?

James: Cause I'm a boy, Michelle. I'm a real live boy.

Orla: Aw, yeah, like Pinocchio.

Michelle: (touching Erin's hair) Listen be sexy, okay?

Erin: Sexy, right.

Michelle: I said be sexy, not be a fucking blowfish, Erin.

James: Hello, mate.

Michelle: We heard you boys are having a party.

Jon: No?

Michelle: Well yous are now.

Erin and Michelle whisper to each other.]

Erin: (whispering, to Michelle) Do you think James knows how much he looks like a… a flaming flamingo?

Michelle: (stifling laughter) I’m not sure. He seems proud of it.

James: (joining in) Come on! These trousers are waterproof. I could stomp through a flood and still keep my dignity.

Erin: Dignity? In pink that loud? I’d hear you from the moon, lad.

Mary: (offstage, calling) Michelle! Erin! Why are you two sneaking around like you're planning a bank heist?

Michelle: (boldly) Mammy, we want to swap Harry.

Mary: Swap Harry? What are you on about?

Erin: Harry from Friends Across the Barricades. You know, Michelle’s crush.

Michelle: We figured if Erin gets Harry, I get... well, someone else.

Mary: (exasperated) You can’t just swap people like you swap sandwiches!

James: (poking in) What about me? Am I part of this trade?

Erin: (ignoring him) Clare, you’re not talking. You’re not even blinking. What’s wrong?

[Clare lifts her head slowly. She opens mouth to speak.]

Erin: Speak, Clare. We can’t make plans in the dark.

Clare: (softly) I…I heard everything last night.

Michelle: (concerned) About Harry?

Clare: About you all… about everything.

[In the pause, James stands firm, pink trousers glinting under lights. Erin looks torn; Michelle hopes.]

Mary: (entering room) Finally, some sense returning.

Erin: (to Michelle) What's wrong with Clare? She hasn't said two words since last night.

Michelle: Well, I'm not complaining.

James: I just did it for a laugh. The trousers. I'll do anything for a laugh, me. I'm mad like that.

(Orla shoves James.)

Jon: Right.

Michelle: All right, there they are.

Erin: Okay, if we're gonna do this, Michelle, we need to do it delicately.

Michelle: Of course. Oi! Lads! We want to swap!

Erin: (annoyed) Brilliant!

Dee: Swap?

Michelle: Yeah. Erin's gonna have Harry now and I'm gonna have you, all right?

Sister Patrick has left the school for a missionary work in Belfast. Ms. De Brn is the new English teacher.,22,20,"[In the school corridor. Erin and Orla are waiting outside their English classroom. Erin clutches a small prayer card.]

ERIN: I still can’t believe the Statue of the Child of Prague is here in school. Did you hear Ms. De Brn got it from the Bishop himself?

ORLA: Aye—just passed around the Derry Diocese like a holy hot potato.  

ERIN: It’s supposed to bring good luck. Maybe it’ll bless my essays, finally.

ORLA: Or maybe Ms. De Brn will use it as a punishment. “Miss a comma, thou shalt not pass.”

(Ms. De Brn opens the door.)

MS. DE BRN: Good morning, girls. Hope you’re ready for English—today we begin poetry.

ERIN: Morning, Ms. De Brn. Will the Child of Prague help us with rhymes, do you think?

MS. DE BRN: Possibly. But I expect you to work as hard as if you were standing in front of him.

ORLA: Even if we mess up, he might forgive us?

MS. DE BRN: With enough effort, yes. But I’m not a saint.

(They enter classroom; Sister Michael is inside placing the statue on a shelf.)

SISTER MICHAEL: Classes are about to begin. I’d like to remind everyone Sister Patrick will not be returning—her missionary work in Belfast starts next week.

ERIN (whispering to Orla): That’s where all the drama is, right?

ORLA: Belfast... the big leagues of trouble.

MARY: (offstage, calling through window) Erin! Don’t forget your blazer! And who’s taking care of the Child of Prague during Georgina’s lockdown?

GERRY: (following Mary) I saw him—statue’s safe. Sister Michael’s minding him.

ERIN: Thank God. I couldn't live with myself if the Bishop got word that we lost his Baby Jesus.

MS. DE BRN: Now, for today’s poem: explore injustice. Compare your knee-jerk reactions to suffering—Saints, statues, and school alike.

ORLA: (to Erin) This’ll be good. Maybe I’ll write about that time Mammy banned us from the bridge.

ERIN: That, and how Sister Declan died... except almost ninety-eight didn’t stop us freaking out.

MS. DE BRN: Excellent material. You two—pull up chairs. And remember—violence is less helpful than understanding. Even for statuary.","[In the assembly hall at school.]

Sister Michael: As you all know, at the beginning of term, the Bishop graciously bestowed a beautiful piece of religious art onto Our Lady Immaculate College, the enchanting Child of Prague.

(She pulls away a piece of fabric to reveal the statue.)

(James looks deeply confused.)

Sister Michael: There we are. Sure, isn't he a great fella altogether?

James: I still don't get what it's supposed to be.

Michelle: It's Jesus as a wain.

James: (tilting his head) Why's he got a big red hat on?

Michelle: Nobody knows.

Sister Michael: It was the Bishop's wish that he be passed around all the schools in the Derry Diocese. Therefore we are joined this morning by Mr. Malone, headmaster of St. Benedict's, so that the handover ceremony can take place. You are very welcome, Mr. Malone. Though I fear you may have had a wasted journey. I've thought about it, and I'd much rather just hold onto him, actually. (she smiles) He brightens up my office. (sternly) He doesn't answer back.

(The kids look awkward.)

Sister Michael: I like the fella. And if the Bishop has a problem with that, he can take it up with me. Now, what else was there? (she takes a sheet of paper) Ah, yes. Sadly, Sister Patrick has decided to leave us.

(Erin yawns.)

Sister Michael: She's returning to her missionary work, educating the heathen inhabitants of a primitive and savage place.

Woman: She's taking a teaching post in Belfast, Sister.

Sister Michael: Precisely. The Board of Governors promised me that her replacement would arrive today, but as usual they were talking out of their

Michelle: What’re you writing, Erin?

Erin: It’s a love story... for someone special.

[James slips in behind Michelle.]

James: Ah, romance! Are you going to read it out loud?

Erin: Not yet. I just used a word and they’re asking me what it means.

Michelle: Which word? Is it one of those posh words like “beguile” or something?

Erin: No—it’s “bide.” I wrote: “He will bide with her until dawn.”

Michelle: Bide...? What does that even mean? Stay? Wait?

Erin: Exactly, sort of. “Bide” means to stay somewhere or remain somewhere for a time… to wait.

James: So like when Dad says he’ll bide till the craic’s over before going home?

Erin: Yes, James, exactly like that—but in a romantic way, not your da’s pub habits.

[Mary sticks her head in the door.]

Michelle: Mam, can you help? What does “bide” mean?

Mary: “Bide” is like when you wait for something good—you don’t rush it. You stay patient, you hope.

Erin: Thank you, Mam. Finally someone gets it.

James: So in your story, the lad bides with the lass because he’s waiting for love, not because he’s stuck?

Erin: Precisely! Get your brains in gear, James.

Michelle: Right, now I understand. Go on, read more!","[In the Quinn kitchen. The kids are eating junk food and writing.]

Clare: (frustrated) God, this whole writing-from-the-soul carry-on is a nightmare.

James: I know.

Michelle: What rhymes with ride?

Clare: Bide.

Michelle: Bide? What the fuck does bide mean? Bide. That's not a word.

Clare: It is a word, Michelle.

Michelle: Bide? You've pure made that up.

Erin: Can we all be quiet? Please.

Orla: (holding up a picture she drew of James) What do you think, James? You've got red eyes cause I ran out of brown.

James: My eyes are green.

Orla: Now you tell me. (she looks distraught)

Erin: Okay. So, I'm trying not to think too much. Just to sort of let it flow through me.

Michelle: Aw, that's minging Erin.

Erin: (annoyed) Here's what I have so far. You know we belong together, you and I, forever and ever. No matter where you are, you're my guiding star.

James: Isn't that the theme tune to Home and Away?

De Brún’s living room. Soft lamplight. Erin, James, Michelle, Orla, and Clare sit on a worn couch and armchairs. De Brún enters with tea tray.]

De Brún: (smiling) Here we are. Hot tea and biscuits. Nothing too fancy—just us.

Erin: (accepting cup) Thanks, Ms. De Brún. This is lovely.

Clare: This house feels so warm. Like it’s breathing.

Michelle: I like your curtains, Ms. De Brún. They’re purple—but not too scary purple.

James: (peeking at photos on mantelpiece) Who’s that man in the sailing boat?

De Brún: That’s my father. He loved boats. Used to take me out every summer.

Orla: You’re lucky. My grandma once took me on a paddleboat. I almost drowned.

Erin: Orla! You’re always dramatic.

Orla: A little drama is good. It keeps the heart beating.

De Brún: (laughs) Would anyone like more tea? Or perhaps some hot chocolate?

Michelle: Hot chocolate, please! With marshmallows if you have them.

James: Yes! Marshmallows are essential to any evening.

Clare: I’ll have tea, thank you.

Erin: Hot chocolate for me too.

[De Brún pours drinks, handing them out.]

De Brún: So, tell me honestly—what do you like about me so far?

Erin: (considering) You’re... different. You listen.

Michelle: And you don’t always punish us. You talk.

James: You laugh. And sometimes you let us choose the music.

Orla: You don’t judge. Even when we fight, you don’t take sides. That’s nice.

De Brún: (quietly) Thank you. That means more than you know.

Clare: It’s weird—just two days. Feels like I’ve always known you.

Erin: Me too. I was braced for lectures, uniforms, rules. Instead, you let us be.

[Door creaks. De Brún pauses.]

De Brún: Shall I put on some music?

Erin: Yes! Something rock or Gaelic or—

Michelle: Anything but funeral dirge.

Orla: (grinning) Or opera. Let opera surprise us!

[De Brún presses play; gentle guitar strumming begins. The room softens.]

De Brún: There, just some acoustic folk. Thought it might suit the moment.

James: It suits. Feels… peaceful.

Erin: (raising her mug) To new beginnings. And to you, Ms. De Brún.

Everyone: To Ms. De Brún.

[They clink mugs. Music plays. Moments of comfortable silence.]

Clare: Will we do this again? Night at yours?

De Brún: Of course, Clare. My door’s always open.

Erin: (smiling) Then tonight, I think I just found a home away from home.

De Brún: And I’m honored to share it with all of you.","[On the street at night.]

Erin: Ms. De Brn's amazing. I've just never met anyone like her.

James: She's an inspiration.

Clare: Absolutely.

Michelle: She really knows how to grab things by the balls!

Clare: Oh yeah!

(Orla looks confused.)

Erin: She's changed my life, she really has.

James: (beaming) She likes my accent.

Orla: I'd die for her.

Erin: I think I would too, you know.

James: Me, too.

Michelle: Aye, fuck it. Why not?

Clare: Yeah! I mean, obviously, I totally agree, I'd die for her as well, but I'm also conscious of the fact that we've only known her, like, two days.

Erin: And?

Clare: Well, is it a bit weird she's invited us round to her house at night?

Erin: What do you mean?

Clare: Well, she's a teacher.

Erin: She's much more than a teacher.

Clare: Yeah. No. Obviously. I get that. She's great, but it's just that I've a feeling it might be, sort of, frowned upon.

Erin: God, Clare. You're so conditioned.

Clare: What's that supposed to mean?

Michelle: It means you need to loosen the fuck up.

Clare: I am loose, thank you very much.

Michelle: Face it, Clare, you're a craic killer.

Clare: (stops walking) I'm not a craic killer.

3. Jenny Joyce: Maybe she just needed to get away. Ms. De Brn’s place has a fire in the fireplace. Warm.

4. Erin: Warm’s one thing. But her tears were warm too. Real hot.

5. Jenny Joyce: (scoffs) You and Clare, you two are cut from the same cloth, Erin. Reckless, stubborn.

6. Erin: Reckless? Maybe. But I won’t just leave her to sober up alone in someone else’s house.

Erin: Dunno. Probably politics. Or hiding from us lot.

Sister Michael: Today’s lesson is poetry. I want each of you to write about something you care deeply about.

Orla: (in thought) Conflict? Identity? The bridge? Bombs?

Erin: (leans over) Don’t you dare write about bombs again. I’ve done enough trauma.

Sister Michael: Erin, your voice is important. If you want to write about bombs, write about your truth.

Dennis: I could find a similar set from a second-hand shop but it won’t be official.

Michelle: Half now for me too. Clare? You okay with late payment?

Clare: I’ll scrape together what I can. Work at the shop this weekend.

James: Could we call it 1.76?

Dennis: No, we fucking couldn't.

Erin: How about, we give you the 1.76 and pay the rest off in instalments?

Clare: Yeah, which would be what? 3.56 over four weeks?

Dennis: Jesus, check out Rain Wain.

Jenny: It doesn’t have to be fancy, just respectful. Zara’ll be coming with us.

Aisling: Half-Protestant, yeah? Doesn’t that count?

Jenny: It does. But you know her Mam likes tradition. We’ll need something that says “peace offering,” not “you’re culture’s crap.”

Siobhan: You off to the shops?

Jenny: We are, Mam. We’re buying a present. For Zara’s Protestant part of the family.

Siobhan: (sips tea) Bridging the divide, are we?

Aisling: Something like that. Jenny’s being very grown up.

Jenny: She’s good friends with Zara. And her horse—Donny—he’d love treats too. Maybe we get something horsey.

Siobhan: Just stay away from anything that’ll start an argument, girls.

[On the street. Jenny and Aisling, walking. Zara meets them, tied to her horse Donny under a hedge.]

Zara: Hey! Ready to shop?

Jenny: Aye. We thought maybe stable stuff for Donny. And something for you and your family.

Aisling: But not too “Protestant,” or they’ll think we’re mocking them.

Zara: My Dad likes oak things. Protestant or not, he loves woodwork.

Jenny: Oak. Good. Solid.

Aisling: Look at that, oak photo frame.

Jenny: Could put a picture of Zara and Donny in it.

Zara: I have that photo! (Pulls out phone) It’s lovely.

Vendor: Ah, you girls need help deciding?

Jenny: Yes please. Something meaningful.

Vendor: Perhaps this oak bread board—solid, handmade. Symbol of unity, sharing.

Aisling: That could work.

Zara: That’d be perfect for their kitchen.

Jenny: And Donny? What about some carrots?

Vendor: (smirks) Not with me, lass. But there’s a feed stall just down.

Jenny: Right. Let’s get this board, and pick up carrots after.

Aisling: I think your Dad will like it, Zara.

Zara: And Donny will be nobbled with joy.

Jenny: You read my mind.","[On a road. The kids are walking.]

Jenny: Because I know what they like. (smiling smugly) I happen to be very good friends with a half-Protestant.

Clare: What?

James: (firm) I’ll risk it. They lost everything in the fire. And now you ask me to abandon them?

3. Mary: (swaying) But… what are they doing here, at this… scene? I mean… I shouldn’t be saying this— but it looks bad.  
4. Sarah: Bad? It’s awful, Mary. If anyone sees those earrings—people’ll talk. This is not just grief now, it’s trouble.

14. Sarah: Safe? In this house? With the rumours flying? With Granda Joe talking to the neighbours?

Mary: No, Sarah. Look! The earrings. Look at the earrings!

Clare: Get off me! (shoves Michelle aside)

Granda Joe: That’d upset the balance.

Sarah: Mammy’s already frightened her garden shed will get converted into a chapel.

Mary: Sister Michael, sure we like our faith and all, but I don’t need the church running every minute of the clock.

Sister Michael: It’s about precedent. If we start closing schools for heads of state—

Erin: Mammy, you’ll get a lie in tomorrow!

Mary: Don’t you tempt me.

Orla: (licking spoon) Is there cake for this holiday? You know I celebrate with cake.

[They all look at Sister Michael.]

Sister Michael: I’ll speak to the bishop. Try to keep things under control. But yes—expect grand gestures.

Erin: Grand gestures? Mammy, gran, would you rather see the Pope or the President first?

Mary: Don’t be ridiculous, Erin. Both give me palpitations.","[Time lapse.]

Jenny: (singing) Christmas time.

Aisling: (singing) Silent night.

Jenny: (singing) Mistletoe and wine.

Aisling: (singing) Holy night.

Jenny: (singing) Children singing Christian rhyme.

Jenny and Aisling: (singing) With logs on the fire and gifts on the tree, a time to rejoice (Jenny shakes tamborine) in the good that we see. (Jenny hits triangle)

Michelle: That totally just wrecked my buzz.

Sister Michael: Great stuff altogether. A fitting rendition of what I consider to be the most God awful song ever written. Just one announcement today, girls. I'm sure many of you will have guessed what it's about. Although tomorrow is not officially a public holiday, schools across the city have decided to view it as such. Because tomorrow, the President of the United States of America is coming here, to Derry.

(Clare smiles with delight.)

Sister Michael: You're a little young to perhaps understand the enormity of this. A few short months ago, this would have been unimaginable.

(Erin smiles proudly.)

Sister Michael: But here we are. And I for one can barely believe it.

(Michelle and James smile.)

Sister Michael: I mean, people in this place stop killing each other for five minutes and the whole world loses the absolute run of itself! This visit concerns me for a number of reasons, girls, but mostly because I am scared it will give the Pope ideas, and that's the last thing I need. No. Our Lady Immaculate will play no part in this farce. And I expect to see you all here tomorrow morning, business as usual. Is that clear?

(Silence.)

Sister Michael: Is. That. Clear?!

Crowd: (miserably) Yes, Sister Michael.

Sister Michael: (blesses herself) The Father, Son, Holy Spirit."

Clare, Michelle, Erin, Orla and James clustered around the table. James tapping angrily on mug; Orla reading something on phone.]

Erin: I’m telling you, she’s gone too far this time. Chelsea thinks she's queen of the school.

Clare: Aye, and we’re the peasants in her court. It’s not fair.

Michelle: She was slaggin’ me in front of everyone yesterday. Said I look like I slept in my uniform.

James: She’s been acting the maggot since the start of term.

Orla: Fine, what are we doing about it? Complaining never worked before.

Erin: We’ll teach her a lesson. A lesson she’ll never forget.

Clare: Are you thinkin’ what I’m thinkin’?

Michelle: Sicknote from Mam? Disappearing to the loo forever?

James: No. Truant.

Orla: You mean… skip school? All of us?

Erin: A protest. We don’t go in. Not one of us. She won’t know what hit her.

James: My Ma’ll kill me.

Clare: She won’t know where I am, anyway. Trust me, I’ve got it sorted.

Michelle: And what about homework? Teachers notice absence.

Erin: We’ll tell ‘em we’re sick. All of us. A grand conspiracy.

Orla: I like this. Feels revolting but... cathartic.

James: I’m in. But where do we go?

Clare: To the common area near the bridge. Sit comfy, bring snacks. Make a scene.

Michelle: Brilliant. Public protest truanting. As if!

Erin: We’ll take signs. “Chelsea’s Cruelty Off Duty”, that sort of thing.

Orla: I’ll make flyers on my phone. With Chelsea’s face and slogans.

James: You’re savage, Orla.

Erin: Don’t worry, we’re not cruel. Just making a point.

Clare: So tomorrow, first bell, not there. Got it?

All together: Got it.

Michelle: Erin—

Erin: Yeah?

Michelle: Promise you’ll stay with us. No backing off.

Erin: Promise.

Orla: God, I can’t wait to see the look on her face.

James: This is going to be epic.

[They lean in, whispering excitedly, plotting.]

Clare: Everyone ready? Tomorrow morning… revolution.","[In the corridor.]

Clare: She can't do this. She simply cannot do this.

Michelle: Well, she's done it, Clare.

Clare: But it's history! She's making us miss history!

Orla: Och, but I really wanted to find out what that Cromwell fella got up to next. I really enjoy him!

Clare: Not history class, Orla. Real history. History being made!

Erin: And Irish people aren't allowed to enjoy Oliver Cromwell, Orla.

Orla: Why?

Michelle: Because he was a fucking arsehole!

James: Look, Bill doesn't even get here until four o'clock tomorrow.

Michelle: ""Bill""? Who are you, his ma?

James: We've got plenty of time, is all I'm saying.

Clare: Do you know how packed that Guildhall Square is gonna be, James? You'd have to camp overnight just to get a glimpse of him.

Erin: Chelsea will sort us out.

Clare: Och, I'm not even sure I trust Chelsea anymore!

Michelle: Aye, Chelsea might be flaky.

Orla: She does have crafty eyes.

Erin: Okay, I'm not comfortbale with the Chelsea-bashing, girls.

Clare: This is the biggest thing that's ever happened here. That's ever likely to happen here. We should be a part of it!

Michelle: We will be.

Clare: Are you suggesting we play truant?

Michelle: Okay, normal people don't call it that, but yes, yes I am.

Clare: You know what, girls? Sometimes, in order to do the right thing, you have to do the wrong thing. And on this occasion, right is wrong, and wrong is right!

Michelle: What the fuck are you on about? Are you gonna sack off school or not?

Clare: Let's do it!"

Uncle Colm explains that he is American's thirty-fifth president, whereas JFK was the twenty-eighth.",19,16,"[Inside Gerry’s old hatchback, afternoon. Gerry is driving. Jim in front passenger seat. Joe and Uncle Colm in the back.]

Gerry: So, I still don’t get it – why’d they bring Bill Clinton to Burt’s funeral?

Jim: Aye, Gerry, sure I thought he was still President or something spectacular like that.

Joe: Clinton’s from over there, is he? America, isn’t it? What business has he got with Burt?

Colm: Right, lads. Settle down. Bill Clinton was the thirty‐fifth President of the United States.

Jim: Thirty‐fifth, you say? Didn’t JFK get shot? He was like number… what was he?

Colm: JFK was the twenty‐eighth. Thirty‐fifth was Clinton—William Jefferson Clinton, served 1993 to 2001.

Gerry: Jesus, Colm, you're like a walking history book. So Clinton’s way after Kennedy.

Joe: I thought Kennedy was like, after World War II, but before Vietnam?

Jim: Exactly, Joe. Kennedy was much earlier. Clinton won later elections. So what’s the link with Burt now?

Colm: Well, that’s the thing – there’s no real link. They brought Clinton ’cause Burt was big on charity, had connections. They wanted someone international.

Gerry: Charity, fair enough. But still, seems a bit over the top.

Jim: Ye think maybe they just wanted the prestige? A big name to show they mean business.

Joe: Or maybe Burt paid for it. That kind of funeral don’t come cheap with ex‐Presidents turning up.

Colm: Could be any of those. But bring it back home – makes us wonder about our own politics, our own leaders.

Gerry: True enough. Though I’ll never understand why Americans number their Presidents the way Colm just did.

Jim: It’s like collecting football cards, but you're voting them in instead of trading them.

Joe: Next thing you know, they’ll be giving numbers to pets. “This is Rufus, he’s the forty-second dog of the house.”

Colm: (laughs) Right, that I’d pay to see. But let's just say, Clinton being thirty-fifth and JFK being twenty-eighth – that’s how the lineage runs. And Burt wanted to honour that kind of legacy.","[In the car. Gerry is driving. Jim in the passenger seat. Joe and Colm are in the back. It is dark outside.]

(They drive past a sign saying 'WELCOME TO BURT'.)

Gerry: It just doesn't make any sense, Jim.

Jim: I heard him say it. As clear as day, it was.

Gerry: Burt? Why would they bring him to Burt?

Jim: Well that's what's so clever about it. Nobody's going to go looking for the president of the USA in Burt, now, are they? Sure, if you went about saying Bill Clinton was in Burt, people would think you were clean mad.

Gerry: Precisely. Look, lads, if you want my opinion...

Granda Joe: We don't!

Gerry: Grand.

Uncle Colm: This Clinton boyo is actually American's fourty-second president, which is interesting now, because JFK, well, he was the thirty-fifth.

Granda Joe: Why is that interesting?

Uncle Colm: Well, it's not really, I suppose. Sometimes I'll just say something to get me from one sentence to the other, Joe. You know how it is.

Jim: It should be just up here on the left.

Uncle Colm: I'm not sure what number Nixon was, now, or the man, what do you call him? The beardy fella in the hat. The one that knocked the oul slavery on the head?

Gerry: Lincoln.

Uncle Colm: The very boy. But then there was the twenty-seventh..."

They are back in the same place.,25,20,"[In Gerry’s car, evening. Gerry driving, Granda Joe in the passenger seat. They pass the “WELCOME TO BURT” sign.]

Gerry: There it is again. Welcome to Burt. You’d think by now I’d know the place like the back of me hand.

Granda Joe: (peering out) That sign looks the same as last night, Gerry. Maybe we’re stuck in a loop.

Gerry: Oh come on, Joe. Don’t start with your conspiracy theories now.

Granda Joe: I’m only saying. The road looked different, the lamp posts new. Or maybe it’s just my eyesight.

Gerry: Probably your eyesight. Or your head. Did you sleep at all?

Granda Joe: Slept like a baby. Woke up every two hours screaming.

Gerry: (sighs) You had the fire alarm in your dreams again.

Granda Joe: I told you, it wasn’t a dream. I could hear bombs.

Gerry: Bombs? This isn’t Belfast, Joe.

Granda Joe: In my mind it is. These roads, these signs — they all bring me back.

Gerry: You’re too old for this, Pops.

Granda Joe: And what about you, Gerry? You think I’m the only one haunted?

Gerry: I’m just glad the girls are asleep. If Erin saw this sign again, she’d have something to say.

Granda Joe: Orla’d probably write a poem. Erin’d want to debate it.

Gerry: That’s exactly it. Erin—always with her arguing, her questions. You never quiet are you, Erin?

Granda Joe: Not like me. I’m quiet now. Quiet is dangerous.

Gerry: (glancing at him) You still planning on going to Roscarna Road tomorrow?

Granda Joe: Aye. Something didn’t sit right with me there.

Gerry: You think there’s more to this place than just memories and walls?

Granda Joe: There’s always more, son. Always more.

Gerry: (pulling over) I’ll stop. You want a cigarette?

Granda Joe: If you like. Let’s sit here a moment. Look at that sign again. Let it sink in.

Gerry: (turns off engine) Welcome to Burt.

Granda Joe: (softly) Welcome home.","[Time lapse. It is morning. Joe has fallen asleep.]

Uncle Colm: America's thirtieth. And then there was the lad they named all the vacuum cleaners after.

Gerry: Jesus wept. How much further, Jim?

Jim: It should be just up here on the left.

Gerry: We're back in the same place.

Uncle Colm: And Kennedy, of course, the poor critter.

Gerry: How?

Uncle Colm: Lovely fella. Hands on him like shovels.

Gerry: How the feck are we back in the same fecking place?!

Granda Joe: (waking up) What's going on?

Gerry: I've driven one-hundred-and-seventy-eight miles and I'm back where I was five fecking hours ago, Joe, that's what's going on!

Granda Joe: You stupid bloody eejit!

Uncle Colm: Thon Reagan character, he was another.

Gerry: (furious) STOP LISTING PRESIDENTS, COLM!!

Granda Joe: He'll list presidents if he wants to list presidents!

Jim: Aw, there it is! Roscarna Road! That's it! That's what they said!

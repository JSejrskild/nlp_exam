[In Erin's bedroom. The kids enter.]

Michelle: Well I'm not letting that fat, furry fuck ruin the biggest day of my life!

Erin: (sitting on her bed) What can we do?

(James, Clare and Orla sit on the bed beside Erin.)

Michelle: Right, listen, girls. I've never told anyone this before but sometimes when Robbie's being interviewed, it's like he's sending me messages through the TV, you know, like telepathically or whatever. It's like he's saying we're meant to be together.

Erin: Aye, maybe don't tell that to anyone again, Michelle. Ever.

Michelle: Look, this is too important. I'm going to that concert. I'm not afraid of a fucking polar bear!

Erin: Me either.

James: Nor me.

Michelle: Bastard!

Orla: (sucking a lollipop) I'll kill it with my own two hands if I have to!

Erin: Bring it on!

Michelle: Yes!

Clare: Okay, we seem to have gone down a weird road here, people. I think we just got a bit confused. We don't actually have to fight a polar bear, and, if we did, I wouldn't really fancy our chances because, well, they're massive!

Orla: But there's five of us, so

Clare: The point is, the polar bear's not the one stopping us going to the concert. It's our mothers, and we'll never get them to change their minds.

Michelle: We're not going to try to change their minds. We're going to do something else.

James: What?

Michelle: (smiling) Lie our holes off.

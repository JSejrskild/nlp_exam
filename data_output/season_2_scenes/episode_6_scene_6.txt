[In Dennis's Wee Shop.]

(Dennis holds up a flag. Clare counts the stars on it.)

Dennis: That'll be 1.99.

Clare: Right.

Dennis: Is there some sort of a problem here, girls?

Clare: Not a problem, as such. More of a question, really.

Dennis: And you think I'm here to answer questions, do you? Who am I? Magnus fucking Magnusson?

James: (smiling) He doesn't answer questions, he asks them.

Dennis: Pipe the fuck down.

(James looks sad.)

Erin: It's just, it's pink, white and purple, Dennis.

Dennis: So?

Erin: Well, it should be red, white and blue.

Dennis: Says who?

Michelle: The rest of the world.

Clare: There's also quite a few stars missing.

Dennis: No, there's not.

Clare: There's only thirty stars here. I mean, there should be fifty, just because the stars represent the states, so-

Dennis: Some of them left.

Erin: Some states left?

Dennis: That's right.

Erin: Some states left America?

Dennis: Yep.

Michelle: When did this happen?

Dennis: The other day.

Orla: God, that's desperate.

Erin: I dunno, I just feel like if twenty states left the USA, we might have heard about it.

Dennis: Ah, they didn't want to make it into a big thing. So these are the new, modern, up-to-date flags. They've just brought them out.

Erin: Okay. It's just, well, I'm not convinced that's actually true.

Dennis: Well why would I lie?

Michelle: Because you bought a fuck load of dud flags and you're trying to get rid of them.

Dennis: GET OUT!!

(The girls run out.)

Erin: What first attracted him to a career in retail, do you think?

(A car pulls up beside the girls. A woman is inside.)

Woman: Hello there. Why don't you hop in?

(Erin looks scared and no one says anything.)

Woman: Och, come on now. Don't be shy.

Erin: Help! Stranger! Stranger danger!

Michelle: Jesus Christ, Erin!

Erin: Help! This woman is trying to abduct us!

Clare: Help! Fire! There's a fire!

Michelle: Fire? What the fuck are you on about?

Clare: It gets more attention! I read it somewhere!

Erin: KIDNAPPER!!

Clare: HELP! FIRE!

Orla: Help! There's a kidnapper on fire!

Michelle: Will yous all just shut the fuck up? It's fine! She's not a kidnapper.

Erin: Well, who is she?

Michelle: My Aunt Cathy.

(Cathy smiles at James.)

James: (looking shocked) Hello, Mum.

(The girls look shocked.)

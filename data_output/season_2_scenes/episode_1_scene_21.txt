[In the English classroom.]

(Ms. De Brn writes her name on the blackboard. As she finishes, she whacks the chalk across the room and sits down with her feet up. She sighs.)

(Erin waits expectantly. Jenny raises her hand.)

Jenny: What is it we should be doing, Miss?

Ms. De Brn: What should you be doing? (puts her feet down on the floor) Now, there's the question. But let me ask you a better one. What is it you want to do?

Michelle: Get pished.

Erin: (annoyed) Hmm.

Jenny: I'd quite like some feedback on the poetry assignment, actually.

Michelle: Dickhead.

Jenny: It counts towards our final grade, people!

Ms. De Brn: This is 12A, right?

Jenny: That is correct, Miss.

Ms. De Brn: And you are?

Jenny: Jenny. Jenny Joyce.

(Ms. De Brn looks through the assignments until she finds Jenny's.)

Ms. De Brn: Here we go. (stands up) The Flower, by Jenny Joyce.

Jenny: You're not going to read it out, are you?

Ms. De Brn: Of course. Poetry should always be read aloud.

(Erin looks inspired. Jenny looks uncomfortable.)

Ms. De Brn: Some flowers are tall, some flowers are small, some flowers barely grow at all. (throws sheet on the floor) Okay.

Jenny: That's not the end.

Ms. De Brn: It should be.

(Jenny looks offended.)

Ms. De Brn: (flicking through the sheets) Here's a poem about a dog. Here's another one about a dog. This one has no name on it. 'An English Rose Among Thorns'?

(James awkwardly raises his hand.)

Ms. De Brn: Yeah, I can see why you might want to remain anonymous, all right.

(James looks embarrassed.)

Ms. De Brn: Dog poem. Poem about a tree. This one's called 'Boys'. I think boys are really class, especially the ones who have a nice ass.

Michelle: (looking proud) It's called a haiku.

Ms. De Brn: That's not what I would call it.

(Michelle looks deflated.)

Ms. De Brn: Dog poem. Dog poem. (throwing sheets on the floor) Oh, here someone's just drawn a picture of a dog.

(Orla looks up suddenly.)

Ms. De Brn: That is not bad, actually. (sets sheet on her desk)

Orla: Thank you very much.

Ms. De Brn: This person has written about how much they love their English class, in an embarrassing attempt to suck up to the teacher.

(Clare looks embarrassed and regretful.)

Ms. De Brn: (continuing to throw sheets on the floor.) Dog poem. Dog poem. Cat poem.

(Erin raises her hand.)

Ms. De Brn: Yes?

Erin: I think a lot of people in this class, and I know no one will mind me saying this, well, they have a very basic grasp of the creative process.

(Michelle gives Erin a dirty look.)

Erin: Whereas I've been writing for years, so I'm really not afraid to put myself out there. To be bold. To take risks.

Ms. De Brn: And you are?

Orla: That's my cousin.

Erin: Erin Quinn.

Ms. De Brn: Erin Quinn. (picks up sheet) Here we go.

(Erin smiles.)

Ms. De Brn: (reading Erin's poem) The bullet's fired on the streets as I lie in my bed, are nothing to the bullets being fired in my head.

Erin: It's about The Troubles, in a political sense, but also about my own troubles, in a personal sense.

Ms. De Brn: No, I understand the weak analogy. This isn't bold, Erin. It's someone failing to be bold.

Erin: I'm sorry if the subtleties of my work were lost on you, Ms. De Brn.

Ms. De Brn: Poetry is truth. And great poetry is raw and real and messy and glorious and ugly. It is dragged from the depths of the soul. It helps us understand each other and ourselves. Do you get what I'm saying?

Erin: (looking emotional) Yes. Yes, I think I do, actually.

Michelle: Not a baldies.

Ms. De Brn: It's not often in life you're allowed to tear up the page and start over. (tears page in half) But I am gonna give you that chance. (throws paper on the floor) Impress me.

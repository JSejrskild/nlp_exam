[Outside the bathroom. Eamonn, Mary and Sarah walk up to the door.]

Eamonn: (opening the door) Agh!

(The bathroom is flooded. The kids turn suddenly, startled.)

Mary: Dear God

Erin: It looks worse than it is.

Eamonn: My mother was right about you people! Wild animals would have more manners!

Orla: We didn't have a plunger, Eamonn.

Eamonn: (furious) Get out! Get out, now!

(Michelle closes the toilet and they turn slowly to leave.)

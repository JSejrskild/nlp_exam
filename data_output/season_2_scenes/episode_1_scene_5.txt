[In Dennis' Wee Shop.]

Dennis: A present for Protestants.

(They all stare back at him. Clare, Erin and Michelle are all eating sweets.)

Dennis: Ah, now, my next Protestant gift delivery isn't due to arrive until Wednesday, and as it stands I'm completely out of stock, what with there being such a high fucking demand for that sort of thing around these parts.

Orla: (turning to the others) That's a shame.

Clare: (enthusiastically pointing) How much for the Subbuteo, Dennis?

Dennis: We'll call it sixteen quid.

(James looks shocked.)

James: Could we call it 1.76?

Dennis: No, we fucking couldn't.

Erin: How about, we give you the 1.76 and pay the rest off in instalments?

Clare: Yeah, which would be what? 3.56 over four weeks?

Dennis: Jesus, check out Rain Wain.

Erin: Or, you could give us the Subbuteo and then we work off the debt?

Clare: (sucking on sweet) Yeah, we could do chores and stuff.

Dennis: Chores? What do you think this is? Little House on the Fucking Prairie?

Orla: (smiling) Do you watch Little House on the Prairie, Dennis?

Dennis: (suddenly furious) Get out!

(The kids look taken aback as they walk out.)

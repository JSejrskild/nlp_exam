[Time lapse. Rita is back in the van, drinking beer and watching the girls happily.]

(The girls move the dead sheep.)

Michelle: This is rank!

Clare: Why are we doing it?

Erin: Because Rita told us to, and I'm scared of her, Clare! I'm very, very scared of her! Why's it so heavy? Aren't they meant to be 90% wool?!

Michelle: Just put your back into it! The sooner this is done, the sooner we're back in the van and on our way to see Robbie.

Clare: Robie! I mean, it so obviously doesn't look right!

Erin: I am not getting back in that van, Michelle! The woman is a maniac!

Michelle: We've come this far now, we're not turning back! Oh, Jesus Christ!

Erin: What is it?

Michelle: Oh, I just put my hand on its hole!

(They all freak out.)

Michelle: Fuck this, let's just make James do it, the lazy bastard.

Clare: Totally. Good idea.

(They drop the sheep.)

Clare: (looking around) Where is James?

(Erin looks at her with worry.)

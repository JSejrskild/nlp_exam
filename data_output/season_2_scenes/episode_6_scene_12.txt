[In the taxi rank.]

Granda Joe: Excuse me, son.

Man: Where to?

Granda Joe: We were just wondering, have you seen the Clintons knocking about around here?

Man: The Clintons?

Jim: We have reason to believe they're staying in this vicinity.

Man: What would the Clintons be doing in Burt?

(A man walks in.)

Man: Heading to the chapel, Bill?

Bill: Aye.

Man: (into mic) Anybody free to pick up Bill from base? Over. Anybody near base at all? Over.

Over radio: All right, back in five.

Man: Five minutes, Bill.

Bill: (nodding and smiling) Good.

Gerry: Now, Jim, would you be open to the following possibility at all, that it may not have been a CIA agent you were picking up on that transmitter of yours. That there is in fact a good chance it was a taxi dispatcher from Burt, ordering a car here to bring Bill to mass?

Jim: He did have a strong Donegal accent, now that you mention it.

Granda Joe: Jesus, Jim!

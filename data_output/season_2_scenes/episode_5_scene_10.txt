[In the Quinn living room.]

(Orla sits in her prom/Easter dress.)

Sarah: Now, close your eyes, I'm just gonna give you a wee light mist, just so it holds for you.

(Sarah sprays Orla's hair with two hairspray bottles.)

Orla: Ooh.

Mary: Och, Sarah, you'll choke the wain!

(Orla coughs. Erin walks in uncomfortably in her blue skin-tight dress.)

Erin: What do you think?

Mary: God aye, it's different, isn't it?

Erin: Different? What does that mean?

Mary: It was nice of Michelle to lend it to you, love, but it just doesn't look very comfortable.

Erin: It's really comfortable, actually. (stumbles across the room) It's like a second skin.

Orla: I wish you would wear your Easter frock, Erin. When we were wee, we always went to parties dressed the same.

Erin: We're not wee, anymore, Orla.

Orla: Aye...

(Erin hands Mary a sheet of paper.)

Mary: What's this?

Erin: It's some guidelines. Things you are and aren't allowed to say to John Paul when he gets here.

Mary: Right.

(Mary scrunches the sheet of paper into a ball. Erin looks appalled.)

Sarah: What time's your date arriving at, Orla, love?

(Granda Joe appears wearing a white suit.)

Granda Joe: He's already here.

(Joe spins happily, showing off his suit.)

Erin: (smiling) You asked Granda to the prom?

Orla: Well, everyone kept saying you have to ask a fella you really like, and he's the fella I like the most.

(Joe bows.)

Sarah: (smiling warmly) Och, Orla, love.

Gerry: You're looking well, Joe.

Granda Joe: It's not all shite you talk, Gerry. (turning to Erin and Orla) Should we head?

Erin: John Paul's picking me up at seven. You go on. We'll see you there.

(Orla runs over to Joe and takes a flower from him. Erin sits down awkwardly at the kitchen table to wait. Mary and Sarah look at her with concern.)

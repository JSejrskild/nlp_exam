[In the school hall. The prom has begun and a band is playing onstage.]

(Clare and Mae walk in together.)

Clare: Wow, Jenny's done some number in here!

Mae: Dick. Don't worry, she won't get away with it.

Clare: What?

Mae: The prom queen thing. Let's just say she'll be wearing red, all right.

Clare: What does that mean?

Mae: Nobody crosses me, Clare.

(Mae walks away.)

Clare: Mae, wait!

(Michelle runs up to Clare.)

Michelle: You look hot.

Clare: Thank you.

Michelle: No, I mean like, actually hot. Like, physically hot. You better not be sweating in that dress, Clare. They won't give me a refund if there's a whiff off it.

Clare: I'm not sweating!

Michelle: Let me check.

Clare: Get off me! (shoves Michelle aside)

Michelle: Christ, I'm at my wits end trying to keep them two lads apart.

Clare: What? You didn't bring both boys to prom, did you, Michelle?

Michelle: I couldn't make up my mind! I thought I could just stick them in two separate corners and go between them, but they won't fucking keep put!

Clare: Imagine that! It's almost like they have their own free will!

Michelle: Tell me about it, it's a fucking nightmare!

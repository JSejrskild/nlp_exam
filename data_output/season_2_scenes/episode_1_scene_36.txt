[On the street.]

(Clare is drunk.)

Clare: I feel all floaty.

Michelle: She's absolutely fucking flying.

(Jenny Joyce appears.)

Jenny: Well, well, well. What are you guys up to?

Erin: Nothing much.

Clare: We've just been hanging out at Ms. De Brn's house.

Jenny: You were at her house? At night? Well, that's a bit inappropriate.

Clare: Your ma is a bit inappropriate.

Jenny: That doesn't even make sense.

Clare: Your ma doesn't even make sense.

Jenny: Is she drunk?

Clare: Your ma's drunk.

Erin: Okay, Clare. I think we get the idea. Lovely seeing you, Jenny.

Michelle: Take care now.

(They walk away.)

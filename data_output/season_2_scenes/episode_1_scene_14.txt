[The next day, on a hill in a field.]

Erin: (to Michelle) What's wrong with Clare? She hasn't said two words since last night.

Michelle: Well, I'm not complaining.

(Orla is clutching onto Jon. James is wearing his pink waterproof trousers.)

James: I just did it for a laugh. The trousers. I'll do anything for a laugh, me. I'm mad like that.

(Orla shoves James.)

Jon: Right.

Michelle: All right, there they are.

Erin: Okay, if we're gonna do this, Michelle, we need to do it delicately.

Michelle: Of course. Oi! Lads! We want to swap!

Erin: (annoyed) Brilliant!

Dee: Swap?

Michelle: Yeah. Erin's gonna have Harry now and I'm gonna have you, all right?

(They say nothing.)

Michelle: Great stuff. (gives thumbs up)

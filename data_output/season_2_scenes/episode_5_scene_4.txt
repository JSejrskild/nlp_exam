[In the shopping mall.]

Clare: Well, now I don't know who to ask.

Michelle: Tell me about it. There's at least five fellas that fancy the arse off me, but I just can't choose.

Clare: Yeah, that's definitely the same.

Erin: I'll be your date, Clare.

Clare: But, Erin, people might talk. They might get the wrong idea.

Erin: Let them. We need to break down these ridiculous conventions.

Clare: Are you sure?

Erin: I'd be proud to have you on my arm.

Clare: (beaming) Thank you.

(The girls walk into a diner.)

Erin: Oh, God. John Paul's over there. Christ, but it's been so awkward since we broke up.

Michelle: For fuck's sake, Erin. He kissed you on the cheek at Kerry Coyle's sixteenth birthday party and then passed out in a puddle of his own boke.

Erin: Yeah, he missed the boat, all right.

Michelle: I'm sure the fact that he's poking a model is some consolation.

(They sit down at a table.)

Erin: Okay, Cara is not a model. She has done SOME modelling. There's a difference.

Orla: I heard she's going to be on Baywatch.

Erin: She is not going to be on Baywatch, Orla.

Michelle: I heard that too. The Baywatch thing.

Clare: So did I.

Erin: They don't have people from Derry on Baywatch, okay? We're just too pasty. Look, it was never going to work out between me and John Paul. I realise that now. Because I'm looking for an intellectual connection, and he wants-

Michelle: (nodding) To ride a model.

Erin: She is not a model.

Clare: (looking startled) Oh my God!

Erin: What?

Clare: It looks like they're breaking up!

Cara: I can't do this anymore!

John Paul: Why?!

Erin: Jesus! Are they really? Are they breaking up?

(Cara gets up and walks away.)

Erin: They are! They're breaking up! This is class.

Clare: What?!

Erin: Later!

(Erin walks towards John Paul's table.)

Clare: Erin, what are you doing?!

Michelle: She has no respect for herself. And coming from me...

Clare: That is bad.

Michelle: Exactly.

(Erin is standing over John Paul. He cries into his hands.)

Erin: Hey. Hey. HEY!

John Paul: Jesus Christ!

Erin: Sorry. What happened there was... well, I slightly misjudged the level of my own voice, I think.

John Paul: You're grand, I was in a world of me own.

Erin: (sitting down) Everything okay?

John Paul: Yeah, yeah.

Erin: You sure?

John Paul: Oh yeah.

Erin: Really? It's just, I couldn't help but notice that you and Cara were sort of breaking up a bit, there.

John Paul: Yeah. I mean, it's all cool.

Erin: Really?

John Paul: It was mutual. It was definitely a mutual thing. Although, maybe she wanted to mutually split up a bit more than I did.

Erin: I see.

John Paul: Now, I'm just not sure it was the right decision.

Erin: It definitely was!

John Paul: We just got each other, you know? I mean, she's so cool, and smart.

Erin: Smart? Really?

John Paul: And she's a model, for Christ's sake.

Erin: She's done SOME modelling.

John Paul: I'm just wondering whether I should, like, go after her and try to sort it out?

Erin: You definitely shouldn't do that.

John Paul: Really?

Erin: Yeah, it's needy. What you should do is take your mind off it.

John Paul: (smiling through his tears) Okay, cool. Sweet. (his smile drops) How?

Erin: Go out with me. I mean, go out with us. Me and my-my friends. We're going to this prom thing on Saturday night.

John Paul: A prom? Sounds sort of...

Erin: Shit?

John Paul: Formal.

Erin: Oh no, it's not. It's actually not at all. It's actually very informal. It's actually really, like, laid-back, chilled, "who gives an F-" kind of thing. It's not a big deal. It's not a big deal AT ALL.

(John Paul smiles through his tears again. Erin smiles.)

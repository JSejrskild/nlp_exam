[In the school hall.]

(Orla and Joe are still dancing. Clare frantically approaches Michelle.)

Clare: Michelle, listen.

Michelle: Well that backfired.

Clare: What?

Michelle: The lads. They worked it out. They've gone to the pub, together.

(Erin and James enter.)

Clare: Look, there's a guy here, he knows Mae and...

Michelle: (to Erin and James) What's going on? Aw, don't tell me. Wank features stood you up?

Erin: Yeah.

Clare: I'm sorry, Erin.

Erin: No, I'm sorry. You were right. I was jealous. Mae's just so cool and exotic and you liked her so much and...

Clare: She's deranged.

Erin: What?

Clare: I met this guy that went to her school, he said she had to leave for, like, being a bully. He said she's seriously unhinged! I think he's a bit pissed off with her to be honest, and I can't blame him because she's giving the Chinese population in Donegal a really bad rap.

Michelle: Typical Donegal man. Always moaning.

(James spots Mae.)

James: There she is.

(Mae stealthily walks onto the stage.)

Michelle: What's she doing?

Clare: She was talking about how she wasn't gonna let Jenny get away with the whole prom queen thing.

James: Jesus Christ, look! Above the stage, look. She's not gonna do a Carrie!

Michelle: Fuck-a-doodle-doo!

Clare: What's a Carrie? What does that mean?

James: You've never seen Carrie?

Clare: No.

Michelle: Aw, it's some film, Clare.

Erin: Amazing.

Orla: (approaching) Aye, you should check it out!

Clare: Expand and explain. Expand and explain!!

(Band stops playing.)

James: So Carrie is voted prom queen and this bully pours a bucket of pig's blood on her.

Clare: Jesus Christ!

James: I mean, lots of other stuff happens too, but that's the sort of relevant bit.

(Aisling walks onto the stage.)

Aisling: Can I have your attention please?

(The group look worried.)

Aisling: And now, the moment we've all been waiting for, it's time to crown our prom queen!

(Mae stands backstage holding a rope.)

Erin: Holy shit!

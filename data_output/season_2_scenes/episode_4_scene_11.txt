[In the kitchen. Gerry is working with the three old women.]

Gerry: (furious) Where are me scallions?! How do you make a salad sandwich if you don't have scallions?! I asked for them ten minutes ago! Come on now, people! Let's get it together, please! And there's a multipack of Taytos still waiting to be bowled up! No cross contamination this time. I want cheese and onion in one bowl, salt and vinegar in another!

(Erin walks in, looking worried.)

Gerry: It is not that difficult, folks!

(Erin notices the scones on the counter. She approaches them.)

Granda Joe: Listen here, you.

Gerry: (looking concerned) Yes, Joe?

(Granda Joe walks over to Gerry and puts his hand on his shoulder.)

Granda Joe: I just want to say (he chuckles giggily in Gerry's face) I think you're doing a fine job. (he squeezes Gerry's cheek) Keep up the good work.

(Gerry looks shocked and confused. Erin looks guilty.)

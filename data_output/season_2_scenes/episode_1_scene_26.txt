[At school. The kids are looking at photographs on the wall with Ms. De Brn.]

Ms. De Brn: It was difficult, so you've just given up? You might fail, so why bother trying?

Michelle: Exactly. Told you she'd understand.

(Orla smiles.)

Ms. De Brn: Have you ever stopped to look at these? These faces from the past. They're not so different from you, really. They had dreams like you do. They had ambitions. But now, they're gone. Dead. Dust.

Clare: (whispering) That's my Auntie Anne third from the left. She's not dead.

Erin: Shhh!

Clare: But she's only fifty-four. She runs the mobile library in Ballymagroarty.

Erin: Quiet.

Ms. De Brn: But did they fulfil those dreams, those ambitions? One day, girls, you too will just be an old photograph in a hallway. You only get one life. Don't be afraid to live it. Find your voice. Make your mark. (she walks away)

(Erin looks inspired. Michelle smiles. Orla looks indifferent. James and Clare look confused.)

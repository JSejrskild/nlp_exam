[In the screen, watching the film. Joe sits between Mary and Gerry. Colm sits between Ciaran and Sarah.]

Gerry: Well, isn't this romantic?

Granda Joe: (shouting) Thon fella's nothing but a fly bastard! Don't you be trusting him!

Gerry: (to Mary) I just want to check, does your father think that they can hear him?

Mary: Shh!

(Doors open suddenly. Three men walk in.)

Man: Apologies, folks. We've just had a wee security alert there. I'm afraid we're gonna have to carry out a wee evacuation. So, if you'll all follow me. Lovely, great stuff.

(They all start walking out.)

Granda Joe: (to Gerry) That's the last time I let you organise a night out.

Gerry: Okay, then.

Mary: What about this Keyser Soze fella?

Sarah: Who's Keyser Soze?

Mary: Exactly!

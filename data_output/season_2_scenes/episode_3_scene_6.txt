[Outside the bus. The suitcase is on the road. The army bomb diffusers have arrived and are approaching the suitcase.]

Soldier on radio: in position. Examining suspect device now.

(Erin, James, Michelle and Clare look anxious. Orla looks excited.)

Clare: Sweet Jesus!

Erin: Aye, this isn't great.

Michelle: Ach, it's not that big a deal.

Erin: They're going to blow up an entire suitcase of vodka, Michelle!

Michelle: I know. Animals.

Orla: Their wee beekeeper costumes are so cracker!

Erin: You're unbelievable!

Clare: (fiddling with her jumper) This is so itchy now!

Michelle: Don't blame me. Blame the milk tray man.

Erin: This is really serious, Michelle. People have gone to jail for less.

James: Why is this place so mental?

Michelle: That's enough, James! You have serious fucking anger management issues, do you know that?

(There is a loud bang as the suitcase is exploded.)

Soldier: 33 Bravo this is 31 Alpha, over.

Soldier on radio: I hear you. Over.

Soldier on radio: All clear here. Over.

Soldier: Roger. Let's pack it up. Over.

(Michelle smiles with relief.)

Soldier on radio: Powerful smell of vodka down here. Over.

(The kids look worried.)

Sister Michael: Vodka, did he say? (turning to the kids) Interesting.

Michelle: Okay, we need to go.

(The kids run away and the crowd watch them in confusion.)

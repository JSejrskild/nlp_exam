Old woman: Three cheese and tomato on brown bread.

Gerry: Brown, right, got it.

Old woman: Four salad on white.

Gerry: Salad, white. Hang on! Are they rectangles or triangles?!

Old woman: Two with no onion.

Old woman 2: We're low on vol-au-vents, Gerry!

Old woman 3: Here, that quiche isn't cooked, Gerry!

Gerry: Sweet suffering Jesus.

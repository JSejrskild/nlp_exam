[In church. The Bridal Chorus plays.]

(The congregation turns to see Sarah walking down the aisle in white. The bride and her father walk behind her. The bride looks annoyed. Sarah squeezes in beside Mary.)

Sarah: Jesus, but that taxi took forever, so it did.

(Mary, Gerry and Erin look at Sarah in disgust.)

(The bride walks past Sarah, giving her a dirty look.)

Sarah: Oh, isn't she gorgeous?

Mary: Give me strength.

[On a country road. The kids walk.]

(Orla is holding a stick in the air.)

Erin: We need a better plan, Michelle.

Michelle: This is a great plan.

Erin: We cannot walk to Belfast.

Michelle: How far could it be? Have you ever seen Northern Ireland on a map? It's fucking tiny.

Clare: I have to say, I'm not overly keen on us being out in the open like this, just because of the whole There's a polar bear on the loose that could maul us to death thing!

Orla: It can try.

Michelle: Is it just me, or is that gypsy an absolute ride?

(Some gypsies stand at a stall at the side of the road.)

Erin: Michelle, you cannot say that!

Michelle: What?

Erin: They're called travellers now. You can't say gypsy anymore. It's insulting.

Michelle: Is it?

Clare: Yes. Yes, it is.

Michelle: Really?

James: Who are they?

Erin: They're just people, James. They're just people exactly like us.

Orla: Except different.

Erin: Yes. No!

Clare: That's actually racist, Orla.

Michelle: No, it's not. They are different.

Erin: They're not.

Michelle: Well, they live in caravans for a start.

Orla: Aw, I wish I lived in a caravan!

Michelle: Aye, me too. Caravans are class!

Erin: Could everybody stop being so racist, please?

James: I'm a bit scared of them. Is that racist?

Erin: Yes.

Clare: Very much so.

Michelle: Is gypsy even a race?

Erin: Traveller.

Gypsy: Well, how are you girls?

Michelle: Well, hello there.

Erin: Hi.

Clare: Good afternoon, Sir.

Michelle: Sir? What the fuck, Clare?

Gypsy: Hey, hold on!

Clare: (frantic) What does he want?

(The kids start walking faster.)

Erin: I dunno.

Gypsy: I'm talking to you!

Erin: Just walk on.

Gypsy: Hey! Are you deaf or what?

(The kids walk even faster and the group of gypsies follow them.)

Erin: Keep your heads down and keep walking.

Gypsy: Get back here!

Erin: Faster. Walk faster.

Gypsy: Am I going to have to come after ya, am I?

James: Jesus Christ, he's following us.

Michelle: Holy fuck!

Erin: Run!

(The gypsies chase the kids down the road.)

Erin: He's obviously a psychopath! Run!

Michelle: He looks fucking raging!

Clare: I don't want to die! I don't want to die!

(Clare screams frantically. Orla laughs.)

Orla: This is some craic, isn't it?

(The gypsies have caught up with the kids.)

James: Holy shit, they're fast!

(They stop running. Erin grabs Orla's stick and holds it up to the main gypsy.)

Erin: Back off!

Gypsy: What?

Erin: Back off, you heard me! I'm not messing around with this thing!

Clare: (holding up her hands) We mean you no harm, Sir!

Michelle: Seriously, Clare. The sir thing, just pack it in.

Gypsy: Why are you being so weird?

Clare: Why are you chasing us?

Gypsy: (holding out a purse to Clare) Because you dropped this.

Clare: My purse.

Gypsy: Why did you think we were chasing you?

(They are speechless.)

Gypsy: Ah right, I see. We're travellers, which means we're psychopaths?

Orla: Aw, you were right, Erin!

Erin: Shut up, Orla.

Gyspy: We run after people and beat them up for no fecking reason.

Erin: No, look, that isn't - 

Gypsy: We're travellers, so we're obviously violent.

Erin: No, not at all. Listen, we have huge respect for you and your people. You've such a strong sense of community and such wonderful, traditional values.

(A van approaches and beeps its horn.)

Rita: These lads bothering you, girls?

Erin: Yes, yes, they are!

Michelle: They're fucking madmen!

Erin: They're going to kill us.

Clare: Help us, please!

Rita: (spits) Jump in.

(The kids run to the van. Orla waves goodbye happily.)

Gypsy: Arseholes.

[In Ms. De Brn's house.]

Ms. De Brn: (holding a glass of wine out to Clare) Some wine?

Clare: Oh, no. Actually, I don't (she hesitates, then holds out her hand) Cheers.

(Clare downs the whole glass of wine.)

Clare: Hit me again.

Ms. De Brn: Okay. (she laughs and pours more wine)

Michelle: You don't have much stuff.

Ms. De Brn: Everything I own can fit into a suitcase.

(Clare downs another glass of wine.)

Ms. De Brn: I've never understood why people weigh themselves down with meaningless crap, you know?

Erin: Yeah, God, I just hate possessions so much.

Orla: Does that mean I can have your Sylvanian Family collection?

Erin: Shut up, Orla.

Ms. De Brn: I don't like to feel tied down, you know. Life should be spontaneous, free.

(James smiles at Ms. De Brn.)

Erin: Big time.

Ms. De Brn: (holding up wine glass) Slainte.

(The kids all hold up their wine glasses.)

Clare: This is actually nice.

Orla: Mmm, it tastes a bit like blood.

Ms. De Brn: Life is no brief candle to me. It is a sort of splendid torch, which I have got hold of for the moment, and I want to make it burn as brightly as possible.

Erin: That's beautiful.

Ms. De Brn: Shaw. It's my favourite quote.

(Clare pours another glass of wine.)

Michelle: Take it easy, Oliver Reed.

Ms. De Brn: What's yours?

Erin: Be careful, child, of the doll made of glass. For if you hold her too tightly, she will break, and you will bleed.

Ms. De Brn: I don't think I'm familiar with that one. Who's it by?

Erin: Me. It's by me.

Ms. De Brn: Wow!

(Erin smiles proudly and nods.)

(Clare downs another glass of wine.)

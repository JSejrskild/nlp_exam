[Time lapse. Miss Mooney is taking a photo of the statue. Sister Michael sits sadly at her desk.]

Erin: How could you have glued his head on upside down, Orla? He's wearing a hat, for Christ's sake!

Sister Michael: Quiet!

(Geraldine Devlin walks in. Mary, Sarah and Deidre are already there.)

Geraldine: All right, Mary, Sarah, Deidre. Your girls involved in this beheading too, then?

Clare: It wasn't me, Mammy!

Geraldine: (furious) Do not speak to me, Clare! In fact, don't even breathe.

(Clare looks shocked. She holds her breath.)

Sister Michael: Take a seat, Mrs. Devlin.

(Geraldine sits down.)

Sister Michael: The statue was stolen from this room, so I've asked Miss Mooney to photograph the scene. Either it is replaced, at your expense, or the school will sue!

Sarah: To be honest, Sister, and I'm not just saying this, I think he looks better.

Sister Michael: He looks like his head's on upside down.

(Mary elbows Sarah.)

Sister Michael: And I'll be suspending them for a week!

Clare: Oh, please God, no!

Deidre: A week? We're going to be stuck with them for a week?

Geraldine: Be reasonable, Sister. We didn't behead the fella.

Mary: By Christ, you're in for it, Erin.

Erin: It was an accident, Mammy.

Sister Michael: Oh, so you accidentally wrote a ransom note, did you?

Erin: Okay, that bit wasn't an accident. But we were so upset by what happened to Ms. De Brn. It was wrong. She shouldn't have been sacked.

Sister Michael: She wasn't.

Erin: What?

(Knock on door. Ms. De Brn walks in.)

Ms. De Brn: Sorry to interrupt, Sister, but if I could just grab the old P45, then I'll be out of your way.

Erin: Excuse me?

Sister Michael: Ms. De Brn has decided to leave us.

Ms. De Brn: I got offered a post in St Dominic's Girls. Better wages, holiday pay, great pension, the works. I couldn't say no, really.

Erin: But what happened to living for the moment? What happened to Life should be spontaneous?

Ms. De Brn: Yeah, I know, but I'm buying a house and the mortgage rates are absolutely crippling at the minute.

Mary: Awk tell me about it.

Sister Michael: Part of the reason I became a nun  free accommodation.

Erin: But Ms. De Brn, you inspired me to do my greatest work.

Ms. De Brn: I see. Which was?

Erin: My poem. My glass doll poem. She's a doll made of glass. She's a glass doll. I read it to you last night.

Ms. De Brn: Yeah, I wasn't really listening, to be honest.

Erin: (shocked) Oh!

(Sister Michael passes something to Ms. De Brn.)

Ms. De Brn: Cheers.

(Ms. De Brn starts walking out the door. She turns to the kids.)

Ms. De Brn: Carpe diem.

(She walks out.)

Michelle: Carpe dickhead.

(Michelle chuckles. Her mum gives her a stern look. She immediately stops laughing.)

Erin: Well, I guess we never knew who the real Ms. De Brn was.

Mary: A bit like Keyser Soze.

Sister Michael: The fella with the bad leg.

Mary: What?

Sister Michael: Keyser Soze. He was the fella with the bad leg. He was talking absolute shite the whole time. He was one of those er, what do you call it? Unreliable narrators.

(Mary and Sarah look shocked and amazed.)

Mary: Well, that's very clever.

Sister Michael: Yeah, I thought so, too.

Miss Mooney: Look this way, girls.

(The kids all stand to get their picture taken.)

[On a road. The kids are walking.]

Clare: Come on girls, this is embarrassing!

Michelle: Well, it's all right for you Clare, but we want to buck these lads. We have to offer them some kind of incentive.

Clare: They're not prostitutes, Michelle! And even if they were, I think a half-eaten packet of Rolos and an Ulster Bank key ring is a pretty insulting form of payment.

James: (smiling and holding up a pencil) I have a HB pencil!

Michelle: (taking the pencil) Happy days.

(Jenny and Aisling appear, holding a large present wrapped carefully.)

Jenny: Hi, guys!

Erin: That's not That's not what you're giving to the Protestants, is it?

Jenny: It's just a little token, really.

Orla: Yeah. So's ours.

Aisling: Is that an Ulster Bank key ring?

Erin: It is indeed, yep.

Jenny: I must admit, I had a bit of an advantage when it came to the whole present buying thing, because

Michelle: You're loaded.

Jenny: Because I know what they like. (smiling smugly) I happen to be very good friends with a half-Protestant.

Clare: What?

Michelle: They don't come in halves, Jenny.

Jenny: They do actually. I met her at ballet class. Her name's zara, and she has a horse.

Erin: Good for zara. Bye bye now.

(They all walk away from Jenny and Aisling.)

Clare: (annoyed) Of course she's friends with a half-Protestant! Of course she is!

Michelle: She has been fucking unbearable since them braces came off.

Erin: Dose.

Clare: (frantically) Well, I'm going to make friends with a full Protestant! See how she likes it. zara won't seem quite so impressive next to my thorough-bred, will she Jenny?!

Erin: Relax, Clare.

Michelle: Why has she got so much money, anyway? Who's her da? Pierce fucking Brosnan?

Erin: He's a surgeon over at Altnagelvin. He took Orla's tonsils out. (climbs into bus)

Orla: And not a day goes by when I don't think about them.

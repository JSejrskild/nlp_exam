[In a dress shop.]

(James is holding dresses and almost falling asleep. Erin walks out of the changing room in a skin-tight blue dress.)

Erin: What do you think of this one?

Michelle: I dunno. I'm not sure it's you, really.

Erin: (struggling to walk) Good. I don't want to be me.

Clare: (holding up a blue dress and a pink dress) Which of these do you like best?

Erin: Definitely the pink.

Mae: Has to be the blue.

Clare: (looking at Erin spitefully) Yeah, I thought the blue.

Michelle: (trying on a dress) This doesn't do my baps any justice.

Clare: Have you decided who you're bringing yet?

Michelle: Well I've narrowed it down to two. There's big Johnny Kells who works in Dunnes. Thick as fuck, but a massive, massive ride. Then there's this other fella, he's not as thick, but he's also not as hot, although I have heard he is really good with his hands. And when I say he's good with his hands, I'm not talking about putting up shelves, girls. I'm talking about...

James: (bored) Everybody knows what you're talking about, Michelle.

Michelle: Fingering. (looking smug)

James: Honestly!

Mae: I can't find anything I like.

Orla: (from the changing room) Well, I'm just so torn. I mean, I love my Easter dress, but this is cracker too. 

(Orla jumps out of the changing room in a purple and orange jumpsuit.) 

Orla: There is just nothing that doesn't suit me.

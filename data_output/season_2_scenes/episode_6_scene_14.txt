[At the school.]

(Sister Michael walks down an empty corridor.)

(Jenny and Aisling sit alone in a classroom.)

Jenny: This is shocking. I mean, what is everybody playing at?

(Aisling rolls her eyes.)

Aisling: What are we playing at?

Jenny: I'm sorry?

(Aisling gets up from her seat and picks up her bag.)

Aisling: Come on, Jenny. For once the world'll be watching us for all the right reasons.

Jenny: But you'll get into trouble, Aisling.

Aisling: I don't care.

(Jenny looks shocked as Aisling happily walks out of the classroom.)

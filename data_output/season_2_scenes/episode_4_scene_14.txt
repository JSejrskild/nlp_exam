[In the room with the dead body.]

(Sarah and Mary are pulling at the earrings on Bridie's body.)

Sarah: You mind your own ear, Mary! Don't concern yourself with mine!

Mary: It won't budge.

Sarah: What are they, like, glued on or something?

Mary: Pull harder!

Sarah: I'm pulling as hard as I can!

Mary: Oh! I got it!

(Mary is holding the earring as Eamonn walks in.)

Eamonn: Mary, look, this is a bit awkward, but there's been a few complaints from the kitchen, about Gerry.

Mary: Och, Eamonn, how are you? What brings you here?

Eamonn: Uh, it's me mother's wake.

Mary: (laughing) Oh, God, so it is.

(Eamonn looks confused. Sarah looks surprised.)

Eamonn: What's going on?

Mary: We we just came in to do a wee decade of the rosary and, sure, didn't Sarah forget her beads.

Sarah: What am I not?

Eamonn: (to Mary) What's in your hand?

Mary: Sorry?

Eamonn: What have you got in your hand?

Mary: Nothing.

Eamonn: Let me see.

(Mary shows her empty hand.)

Eamonn: Your other hand.

Mary: My other hand?

Eamonn: Yes.

(Mary opens her hand to reveal the earring.)

Mary: God! How did that get there?!

Eamonn: Jeepers! Were you stealing Mammy's earrings?!

Mary: Actually, I think you'll find they were our mother's earrings originally, so

Eamonn: What is wrong with you?

Sarah: Oh, we were doing her a favour, Eamonn. They're not flattering.

Eamonn: For God's sake, Mary. First the curse and now this?

Mary: You said there was no curse!

Eamonn: I didn't want to make you angry, Mary! I mean, I'm about to bury my mother, a hex is the last thing I need.

Mary: Aw, for Jesus sake!

(Liquid starts dripping through the ceiling.)

Sarah: (pointing) Eugh, what is that?

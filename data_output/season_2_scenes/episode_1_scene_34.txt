[On the street at night.]

Erin: Ms. De Brn's amazing. I've just never met anyone like her.

James: She's an inspiration.

Clare: Absolutely.

Michelle: She really knows how to grab things by the balls!

Clare: Oh yeah!

(Orla looks confused.)

Erin: She's changed my life, she really has.

James: (beaming) She likes my accent.

Orla: I'd die for her.

Erin: I think I would too, you know.

James: Me, too.

Michelle: Aye, fuck it. Why not?

Clare: Yeah! I mean, obviously, I totally agree, I'd die for her as well, but I'm also conscious of the fact that we've only known her, like, two days.

Erin: And?

Clare: Well, is it a bit weird she's invited us round to her house at night?

Erin: What do you mean?

Clare: Well, she's a teacher.

Erin: She's much more than a teacher.

Clare: Yeah. No. Obviously. I get that. She's great, but it's just that I've a feeling it might be, sort of, frowned upon.

Erin: God, Clare. You're so conditioned.

Clare: What's that supposed to mean?

Michelle: It means you need to loosen the fuck up.

Clare: I am loose, thank you very much.

Michelle: Face it, Clare, you're a craic killer.

Clare: (stops walking) I'm not a craic killer.

(The others walk on.)

Clare: I am not a craic killer!!

Father Peter: I think we all can agree that for generations there's been a deep lack of trust between your communities. And that's where abseiling comes in.

Sister Michael: (rolling her eyes) Jesus Christ.

Father Peter: Abseiling is a great trust-building exercise, because what you're doing is, you're saying to your buddy, 'lean on me, I'm here for you.' Now, let me see who's first. Ah, Clare. Clare Devlin, there you are.

Clare: Ah, I'm not sure about this.

Michelle: (pushing Clare) You'll be grand.

Clare: No, listen, you don't understand.

Father Peter: Now, where's your buddy?

(Philip raises his hand.)

Father Peter: Good man, yourself. Come on up.

(Clare looks terrified. Philip walks towards her.)

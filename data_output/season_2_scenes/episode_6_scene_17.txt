[At the school.]

(Jenny still sits alone in the classroom as Sister Michael walks in.)

Sister Michael: What are you doing here?

Jenny: You told us we had to come in, Sister.

Sister Michael: Ah, for God's sake, Jenny. You need to learn when to push back.

Jenny: What?

Sister Michael: Get out of here. Go on, now.

(Jenny walks out.)

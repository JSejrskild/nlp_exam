[In the Quinn kitchen.]

Mary: I never slept a wink last night, you know.

Sarah: Me either.

Mary: Keyser Soze?

Sarah: Naw. I went to bed with my rollers in. Sure, it's always a nightmare.

Mary: Then why do you do it?

Sarah: I've no volume at the root, Mary. What choice do I have?

Granda Joe: I'm leaning towards Pete Postlethwaite now.

Mary: It wasn't Pete Postlethwaite, Da. It's never Pete Postlethwaite. Look, this is driving me to distraction. We'll have to go back tonight.

Gerry: It's not in the listings anymore, love.

Mary: What?

Gerry: The cinema's stopped showing it.

Granda Joe: Oh, well done.

Gerry: It's not my fault.

Granda Joe: Ah, sure, nothing ever is.

Mary: (worried) What are we meant to do?

Gerry: Wait for them to release it on video.

Mary: I can't, Gerry! I can't go on like this! I need to know.

(Erin and Orla come downstairs.)

Erin: Well, that's us away.

Sarah: (to Orla) Where's your socks, love?

Orla: They're just not for me, Mammy. I'm sorry.

Sarah: You'll be foundered.

Orla: I know what I'm doing.

Erin: Have a great day, everyone.

Mary: What are you in such a good mood about?

(Orla walks out the door.)

Erin: Just, you know, life.

Mary: You're up to something, and I'll get to the bottom of it. Honest to God, Erin, between you and Keyser Soze, my head is turned.

(Orla walks back in.)

Erin: Who's Keyser Soze?

Gerry: God almighty!

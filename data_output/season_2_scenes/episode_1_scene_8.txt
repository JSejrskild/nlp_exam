[Getting off the bus.]

Jenny and Aisling: No hate! No hate! Let's integrate!

(Sister Michael steps out.)

Sister Michael: Kill me.

(The Protestant bus drives in.)

Michelle: (smiling) The Prods have landed!

(Everyone looks excited. The headmistress and the Protestant boys start stepping out.)

Miss Taylor: Single file!

(The boys line up outside the bus.)

Sister Michael: (walking over to headmistress) You must be Miss Taylor?

Miss Taylor: That's right. Well, Janet.

Sister Michael: Michael. Sister Michael.

(They shake hands coldly.)

Miss Taylor: It's a pleasure.

Sister Michael: I know.

Miss Taylor: (to the Protestants) Move it.

Sister Michael: (to the Catholics) Shift it.

(The kids all start walking inside the building.)

Miss Taylor: Why's everyone so desperate for them to mix? I think we should keep them separate.

Sister Michael: (looking impressed) I think we should keep them in cages.

(They exchange evil smirks.)

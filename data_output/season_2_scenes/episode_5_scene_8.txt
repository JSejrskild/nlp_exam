[At the till paying for the dresses.]

(Mae spots a red dress behind the counter.)

Mae: Oh my God! That's the one! (to the cashier) Can I try that one, please?

Cashier: Sorry, love, that's been left over for someone.

Mae: What?

(Jenny walks in with balloons.)

Jenny: Hiya! Sorry, guys, I can't stop.

Michelle: Nobody wants you to.

Jenny: Just grabbing a few wee bits for the prom, sure you know how it is!

(The cashier begins packing the red dress into a bag.)

Mae: Oh, I was actually about to try that one on.

Jenny: (paying) Well, I left it over, so...

Mae: It's just that red's my colour.

Jenny: Yeah, mine too.

Mae: No, you don't understand. I really, really suit it.

Jenny: Yeah, so do I.

(The cashier hands the bag to Jenny.)

Mae: Garnet's actually my birthstone.

Jenny: Well, ruby's mine, so...

Mae: (aggressive) I want that dress, Jenny.

Jenny: Well, you can't have it.

(Michelle and Orla gasp. Erin smiles at Mae smugly. Jenny walks out.)

Mae: Bitch!

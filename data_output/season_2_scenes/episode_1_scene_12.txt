[Night time. Michelle, Erin, Clare, James and Orla sneak out of their room in their pyjamas.]

Erin: I'm not sure about this.

Michelle: I knew you'd fanny out!

Erin: These lads have moves. You said so yourself, Michelle. And I haven't got any moves!

(They walk up the stairs.)

Michelle: Look, let's just get in there, have a few drinks, and just loosen up a bit.

Clare: No! No loosening up! I don't like it!

James: Just be confident, Erin. Boys like that.

Michelle: How the fuck would you know what boys like?

James: Cause I'm a boy, Michelle. I'm a real live boy.

Orla: Aw, yeah, like Pinocchio.

(They reach the boys' door.)

Michelle: (touching Erin's hair) Listen be sexy, okay?

Erin: Sexy, right.

(Erin leans against the wall and pouts.)

Michelle: I said be sexy, not be a fucking blowfish, Erin.

(Erin looks offended and tries to be sexy again. Michelle knocks.)

(Jon opens the door, looking confused.)

James: Hello, mate.

Michelle: We heard you boys are having a party.

Jon: No?

Michelle: Well yous are now.

(They all walk into the room. Orla stares at Jon close to his face. He looks scared.)

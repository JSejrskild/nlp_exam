[In the Quinn kitchen. The kids are eating junk food and writing.]

Clare: (frustrated) God, this whole writing-from-the-soul carry-on is a nightmare.

James: I know.

Michelle: What rhymes with ride?

Clare: Bide.

Michelle: Bide? What the fuck does bide mean? Bide. That's not a word.

Clare: It is a word, Michelle.

Michelle: Bide? You've pure made that up.

Erin: Can we all be quiet? Please.

Orla: (holding up a picture she drew of James) What do you think, James? You've got red eyes cause I ran out of brown.

James: My eyes are green.

Orla: Now you tell me. (she looks distraught)

Erin: Okay. So, I'm trying not to think too much. Just to sort of let it flow through me.

Michelle: Aw, that's minging Erin.

Erin: (annoyed) Here's what I have so far. You know we belong together, you and I, forever and ever. No matter where you are, you're my guiding star.

James: Isn't that the theme tune to Home and Away?

Erin: Is it? (frustrated) Aw, for God's sake!

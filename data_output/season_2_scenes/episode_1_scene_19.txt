Geraldine: (to Clare) Jaffa bastard? You actually said those words?!

Clare: (crying) It just came out, Mammy!

Sarah: (to Orla) But why were you threatening people with a knife, love? (feeds Orla cake)

Father Peter: Okay, one at a time, please.

Philip's dad: Well if you'd wear the bloody hearing aid I paid a fortune for, you'd have heard what she said!

Harry's dad: Girls! Girls! You were fighting with girls!

Granda Joe: (to Gerry) This is all your fault, you know. I knew this would happen. See that child over there

[In the shopping mall.]

Mae: (angrily) I cannot believe she wouldn't even let me try it on.

(Clare scoffs in agreement.)

Erin: Yeah, well, she did leave it over, so...

Clare: She so knew it would look better on you.

Mae: Exactly.

Clare: I heard the whole prom queen thing's rigged as well. I heard she's set it up so she can win it.

Mae: Fuck me, what a total dick! She shouldn't be able to get away with that.

Erin: Look, the only reason we're having a prom is because Jenny organised it.

Clare: So?

Erin: So, if she wants to be prom queen, let her be prom queen.

Mae: Why are you sticking up for her?!

Erin: Why are you slagging her off?!

Michelle: Erin, all we do it slag off Jenny.

Erin: Yeah, well, we've the right to slag her off. We put the hours in. You can't just show up one day and join in!

Clare: (stops and turns to Erin) Mae's one of us now, Erin.

Erin: Mae's an arsehole.

Clare: That's out of order, Erin! She's Chinese, for God's sake!

Erin: She's from Donegal. And can't you see what she's doing? "Oh, I'll take you to prom. Oh, the blue dress is better."

Clare: Oh my God. Are you jealous?

Erin: (chuckling) Yeah, I'm going out with the biggest ride in Derry, but I'm jealous of you and your new friend? Yeah, that's definitely what's happening!

Clare: It does seem like that's what's happening, actually.

Erin: You know what? I don't need this. I'm going.

Clare: Good.

Erin: Grand.

Clare: Great.

Erin: Fine.

(They smirk sarcastically at each other and Erin storms off. She suddenly turns and walks the other way.)

Erin: I went the wrong way.

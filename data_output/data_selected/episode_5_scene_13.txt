[In the school hall.]

(Orla and Joe have arrived.)

Michelle: Jesus, Joe, you're looking well!

Granda Joe: Aye, I know.

Orla: Why isn't anyone dancing?

Michelle: How're you supposed to dance to this old shite?

Granda Joe: Come on, Orla. We'll show them.

(Joe and Orla happily approach the dancefloor and perform a full fifties dance routine. People start joining them on the dancefloor. Clare watches, smiling.)

Michelle: (spots her two dates arguing) Jesus Christ!

Clare: What's wrong?

Michelle: They're talking to each other now. They're actually fucking talking to each other! (runs over, leaving Clare)

(A boy approaches Clare.)

Boy: Are you Clare?

Clare: That's right.

Boy: Hi, I'm Kris. I'm here with Tara Martin. She's... Oh God, where's she gone? (smiles) Tall, blonde, wears glasses?

Clare: Ah, trampy Tara?

Kris: We've just started seeing each other, actually.

Clare: Oh, no, not that kind of trampy. No, we just call her that because she's got quite a heavy gait. You should listen out for it. Anyway, what can I do for you?

Kris: Well, I see you're hanging out with Mae?

Clare: That's right.

Kris: So, I know Mae from back home.

Clare: From China?

Kris: No. Donegal.

Clare: Yes. Right, sorry.

Kris: No worries. Yeah, Mae went to my school. Did she ever tell you why she had to leave?

Clare: HAD to leave?

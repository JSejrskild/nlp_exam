[Time lapse. It is morning. Joe has fallen asleep.]

Uncle Colm: America's thirtieth. And then there was the lad they named all the vacuum cleaners after.

Gerry: Jesus wept. How much further, Jim?

Jim: It should be just up here on the left.

(They pass the same 'WELCOME TO BURT' sign that they passed the previous night.)

Gerry: We're back in the same place.

Uncle Colm: And Kennedy, of course, the poor critter.

Gerry: How?

Uncle Colm: Lovely fella. Hands on him like shovels.

Gerry: How the feck are we back in the same fecking place?!

Granda Joe: (waking up) What's going on?

Gerry: I've driven one-hundred-and-seventy-eight miles and I'm back where I was five fecking hours ago, Joe, that's what's going on!

Granda Joe: You stupid bloody eejit!

Uncle Colm: Thon Reagan character, he was another.

Gerry: (furious) STOP LISTING PRESIDENTS, COLM!!

Granda Joe: He'll list presidents if he wants to list presidents!

Jim: Aw, there it is! Roscarna Road! That's it! That's what they said!

Granda Joe: Well spotted, Jim.

Uncle Colm: Good man yourself, Jim.

Gerry: (sarcastic) Where would we be without you, Jim?

[In the street.]

Michelle: Well, this prom's going to be a full-blown dick fest. You know there isn't even going to be a DJ? Apparently Jenny hired this fucking pensioner band.

(Orla happily waves at someone on the street.)

Erin: Christ. Really?

Michelle: I heard the drummer is at least thirty!

James: I don't feel so bad about missing it now. It clashes with my thing.

Michelle: The creep convention? Seriously?

James: It's not a creep convention.

Michelle: Well, I think a load of perverts getting together to wank over some fella, who fights with hoovers and rides aliens in a telephone box, is the very fucking definition of a creep convention.

James: It's a Doctor Who night. Me and my stepdad used to watch it when I was little.

Michelle: Well someone should have called social services then James!

Clare: (upset) You're not going to the prom then, James? Well, I was going to ask you to be my date!

(Michelle looks disgusted.)

James: I'm sorry, Clare.

Michelle: You were going to ask James to be your date? What the fuck's wrong with you?

Clare: Well it's a bit more complicated for me!

Michelle: You're a lesbian, Clare. Not desperate.

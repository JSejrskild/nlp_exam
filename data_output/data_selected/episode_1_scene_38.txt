[In the English classroom. The kids walk in.]

(Sister Michael is wiping Ms. De Brn's name off the blackboard. Erin's face drops.)

Sister Michael: Take a seat please, ladies.

Erin: Where's Ms. De Brn?

Sister Michael: Gone. And she's not coming back.

Erin: What?!

Clare: I knew it. When I woke up this morning, I had a feeling something terrible was going to happen and also that essentially, deep down, I'm quite an evil person.

Michelle: It's called a hangover, Clare. You'll be grand.

Sister Michael: I will be taking this class for the rest of the term, which makes me want to pull off my own face, but needs must.

Erin: (to Jenny) This was you, wasn't it? What did you do? What did you say?

Jenny: I don't know what you're talking about.

Erin: Aye, so you don't. Supergrass!

Sister Michael: That's quite enough!

Erin: You don't understand, Sister. Ms. De Brn, she touched us.

Sister Michael: What?

Erin: She made us think, she made us feel.

Sister Michael: (sighing) Oh, thank God! That would be all I need.

Erin: You can't sack her! You just can't!

(Clare drops her head into her hand, in pain.)

Sister Michael: (walking towards Erin) Miss Quinn, you appear to be under the misapprehension that you can address me as though you are my equal! I suggest you rein it in, and take a seat.

(The kids sit down and Jenny smiles with satisfaction.)

[In the Quinn kitchen. Mary sits in shock.]

Mary: I just cannot believe it.

Sarah: Listen, Mary, no matter what you've done, you're still my sister. I'll stand by you.

Mary: I haven't done anything, Sarah.

Granda Joe: Exactly, love. Everybody knows you didn't mean to kill the oul boot. God rest her soul.

Mary: I didn't kill her!

Granda Joe: Och, you know what I mean, not kill hex.

Mary: I didn't hex her either, Da! It was just a very tragic

Granda Joe: My mother, she had the gift too, you know. By God, that woman could make her enemies drop like flies.

Mary: Well look, I don't have any gift. There's no dark forces at play here. I just said something unfortunate that happened to

Sarah: Cause her death?

Mary: Coincide with her death!

(Erin and Orla stand by the sink.)

Erin: Right, well, that's the dishes done. Would you like another cup of tea there, Mammy?

Mary: No, I'm fine.

Erin: I'll just grab the Hoover and give the stairs a bit of a going over.

Orla: (eating a lolly) And I'll maybe do a bit of dusting.

Mary: What's gotten into you two? What are you up to? What do you want?

Erin: Nothing. We just thought that we should pull our weight a bit more, Mammy.

Orla: You do so much for us, Aunt Mary.

Erin: And you deserve a bit of a break.

Mary: I can't hex people, girls. It was an accident!

(Gerry walks in.)

Gerry: So how's the wicked witch of the North West?

Granda Joe: Who put 50p in the eejit?

Mary: God, how am I going to go to this wake?

Granda Joe: It'll be grand, love. But listen, see if things do get heated? Try not to rise to it. The last thing we want is another dead body on our hands, here.

Mary: I'll do my best, Da.

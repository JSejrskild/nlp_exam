[Time lapse.]

Jenny: (singing) Christmas time.

Aisling: (singing) Silent night.

Jenny: (singing) Mistletoe and wine.

Aisling: (singing) Holy night.

Jenny: (singing) Children singing Christian rhyme.

Jenny and Aisling: (singing) With logs on the fire and gifts on the tree, a time to rejoice (Jenny shakes tamborine) in the good that we see. (Jenny hits triangle)

Michelle: That totally just wrecked my buzz.

Sister Michael: Great stuff altogether. A fitting rendition of what I consider to be the most God awful song ever written. Just one announcement today, girls. I'm sure many of you will have guessed what it's about. Although tomorrow is not officially a public holiday, schools across the city have decided to view it as such. Because tomorrow, the President of the United States of America is coming here, to Derry.

(Clare smiles with delight.)

Sister Michael: You're a little young to perhaps understand the enormity of this. A few short months ago, this would have been unimaginable.

(Erin smiles proudly.)

Sister Michael: But here we are. And I for one can barely believe it.

(Michelle and James smile.)

Sister Michael: I mean, people in this place stop killing each other for five minutes and the whole world loses the absolute run of itself! This visit concerns me for a number of reasons, girls, but mostly because I am scared it will give the Pope ideas, and that's the last thing I need. No. Our Lady Immaculate will play no part in this farce. And I expect to see you all here tomorrow morning, business as usual. Is that clear?

(Silence.)

Sister Michael: Is. That. Clear?!

Crowd: (miserably) Yes, Sister Michael.

Sister Michael: (blesses herself) The Father, Son, Holy Spirit.

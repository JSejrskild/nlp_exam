[In the Quinn kitchen.]

(Erin is still waiting. Time passes from half seven to half eight. Erin looks upset.)

Erin: He's not coming.

Mary: Och, love. (reaching out to hold her hand)

Erin: I'm gonna go and change.

Mary: Maybe leave it another few minutes.

Erin: I want to get out of this thing.

(Erin awkwardly gets up and starts walking towards the stairs. Mary looks sad. The doorbell rings and Erin stops in her tracks, pulling herself together. She answers the door and James stands there in a suit, smiling.)

James: Your mum rang me.

Erin: But what about your creep convention?

James: Okay, it's not a creep convention, and it's not important. Shall we go?

Erin: Can you give me one minute?

(James nods, smiling. Erin goes upstairs. James paces the floor waiting for her. She emerges in her Easter dress, taking James' arm as they leave.)

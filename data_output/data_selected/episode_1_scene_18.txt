[Inside the building. The kids all sit in a circle with their parents.]

Gerry: (to Clare's mum) Do you know what this is about, Geraldine?

Geraldine: As far as I can make out, these lads tried to throw my Clare off a cliff.

Gerry: Desperate.

(Deidre walks in.)

Deidre: You all right, Mary? How's the big bowl working out for you?

Mary: Great. Great. Thanks very much, Deidre.

Gerry: Well, that got to the bottom of it, all right.

(Mary glares at him. Joe glares at him.)

Father Peter: Is that everyone? Lovely stuff.

(Sister Michael and Miss Taylor look annoyed, with their arms crossed. Sister Michael has her back to Peter.)

Father Peter: Okay, so, there was a bit of a misunderstanding on the expedition today, which unfortunately led to a physical altercation. I thought rather than let it fester, we should talk about it, and start to heal, and repair. So, who'd like to go first?

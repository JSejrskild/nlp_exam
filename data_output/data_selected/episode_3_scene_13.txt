[At the gypsies' stall. The van pulls up. James is happily helping the gypsies.]

(Rita beeps the horn. Orla looks out the window at James while sucking a lollipop. Michelle opens the sliding door.)

Michelle: What are you playing at? Get in the van, fucko!

Gypsy: Does not have to if you don't want to, James.

Michelle: With all due respect, this has got nothing to do with you.

Gypsy: The way you treat this fella is disgraceful.

Michelle: What is going on, James?

James: Jonjo and the lads, well, they just get me, and it turns out, I'm a really good salesman.

Gypsy: He's a natural.

Michelle: So what? You're a gypsy now?

Erin: Traveller!

Gypsy: Actually, gypsy's fine.

Michelle: I knew it.

Rita: Let's get a move on!

Michelle: Right, get in the van. Come on. And do not test me, 'cause we've already missed PJ and Duncan.

Clare: Is that who was supporting them?

Michelle: Aye.

Clare: Oh, I really like them!

James: I'm not leaving, Michelle.

Michelle: Not even for Gary Barlow?

Gypsy: I don't really rate him as a songwriter, you know?

(James looks offended.)

James: I'm sorry, Jonjo, but you've just crossed the line there.

(James gets in the van with the others. Jonjo the gypsy looks devastated.)

[In the corridor.]

Clare: She can't do this. She simply cannot do this.

Michelle: Well, she's done it, Clare.

Clare: But it's history! She's making us miss history!

Orla: Och, but I really wanted to find out what that Cromwell fella got up to next. I really enjoy him!

Clare: Not history class, Orla. Real history. History being made!

Erin: And Irish people aren't allowed to enjoy Oliver Cromwell, Orla.

Orla: Why?

Michelle: Because he was a fucking arsehole!

James: Look, Bill doesn't even get here until four o'clock tomorrow.

Michelle: "Bill"? Who are you, his ma?

James: We've got plenty of time, is all I'm saying.

Clare: Do you know how packed that Guildhall Square is gonna be, James? You'd have to camp overnight just to get a glimpse of him.

Erin: Chelsea will sort us out.

Clare: Och, I'm not even sure I trust Chelsea anymore!

Michelle: Aye, Chelsea might be flaky.

Orla: She does have crafty eyes.

Erin: Okay, I'm not comfortbale with the Chelsea-bashing, girls.

Clare: This is the biggest thing that's ever happened here. That's ever likely to happen here. We should be a part of it!

Michelle: We will be.

Clare: Are you suggesting we play truant?

Michelle: Okay, normal people don't call it that, but yes, yes I am.

Clare: You know what, girls? Sometimes, in order to do the right thing, you have to do the wrong thing. And on this occasion, right is wrong, and wrong is right!

Michelle: What the fuck are you on about? Are you gonna sack off school or not?

Clare: Let's do it!

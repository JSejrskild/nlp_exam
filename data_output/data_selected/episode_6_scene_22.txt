[In the crowd.]

(The crowd continues to cheer.)

Man: And now, ladies and gentlemen, it is my pleasure to introduce the President of the United States of America!

(The girls continue looking miserable.)

(Orla turns to look in the opposite direction, her expression changing to surprise.)

Orla: (pointing) I see him! I see him!

Erin: You're facing the wrong way, Orla.

Orla: No, no, look, it's James!

(Erin turns, and then gets Michelle and Clare's attention as they also turn. They smile lovingly at him at he waves down from the bridge. He shouts something.)

Michelle: What's he saying?

Clare: (chuckling) I don't know.

James: I AM A DERRY GIRL!

Man: A fucking prick is what you are!

(James briefly looks upset, and then his expression changes back to a full smile.)

(The girls run from the crowd to meet James under the bridge.)

(Orla jumps into James's arms. Michelle, Erin and Clare quickly join the embrace. They smile lovingly at James and Michelle wraps him in a flag.)

Bill Clinton: Looking out over these historic walls, I see a peaceful city, a safe city, a hopeful city, full of young people that should have a peaceful and prosperous future here, where their roots and families are.

(The kids walk away from the crowd, arms around each other, smiling.)

Bill Clinton: That is what I see, today with you.

(The crowd cheers. Shot zooms in on TVs in a shop window, displaying Clinton.)

Bill Clinton: And so I ask you to build on the opportunity you have before you. To believe that the future can be better than the past. To work together because you have so much more to gain by working together than by drifting apart. Have the patience to work for a just and lasting peace.

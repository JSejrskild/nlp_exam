[On the street. The kids walk with their bags.]

Michelle: We're doing it for peace, all right, Mary. A piece of that fine Protestant ass!

(Erin and Michelle high-five excitedly.)

Clare: (disgusted) God, you are such a hypocrite, Erin.

Erin: No, I'm not. I just don't think there's anything wrong with some cross-community

Michelle: Fiddling.

Erin: Relations.

Orla: (looking at a map) So we need to head south-east for 0.5 miles and you'll receive further instructions shortly.

Erin: We haven't even left the estate yet, Orla.

Michelle: These Prods have some serious moves up their sleeves, you know. They're not as fucked up about sex as we are. They've put the work in. They know what they're doing.

Clare: They're people, Michelle. They're not sex toys.

Michelle: I beg to differ.

James: I'm really looking forward to making friends with some lads. (smiling)

Michelle: Lads aren't going to make friends with you, James. Lads make friends with other lads.

James: I am a lad.

Erin: Aye, so you are, James.

Clare: (taking money out of her pocket) Okay, how much money do we have?

Michelle: Look, the riding of the Protestants is one thing, but I don't see why we have to buy them a present. I mean they already have all the land, all the jobs and all the fucking rights.

Erin: Aye, Michelle. That's definitely the attitude we should have entering into this weekend.

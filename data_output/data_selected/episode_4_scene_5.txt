[At the wake, in Eamonn's house. Sarah, Mary, Joe, Gerry and Colm walk in. Sarah is wearing a fancy black dress.]

Eamonn: So good of you to come.

Mary: (shaking Eamonn's hand) God, this is a big turnout.

Eamonn: Well, Mammy was just so well liked.

Mary: Right. Really?

Eamonn: I suppose because she was the life and soul, wasn't she? Full of the joys, always laughing.

Granda Joe: We're talking about Bridie here, aren't we?

Mary: Yes, Da.

Eamonn: Look, Mary, there's something I need to say.

Sarah: Is this about the curse, Eamonn?

Eamonn: Sorry?

Sarah: Because Mary's saying she didn't do it and that's good enough for us.

Mary: That's the truth, Eamonn! I wouldn't know where to start with all that carry-on!

Eamonn: No, Mary, no, I was just going to say that my poor mother, God bless her and keep her

Granda Joe: Amen.

Eamonn: Well she didn't mean what she said at the wedding.

Mary: Oh please, you don't need to explain.

Eamonn: You were worried I'd think you'd put a curse on her?

(Sarah laughs.)

Mary: Well

(Eamonn laughs awkwardly.)

Eamonn: That's hilarious.

Mary: Aye.

Eamonn: I mean, obviously, a curse was my first thought. But I looked into it and Mammy's death, it doesn't meet the official requirements. (nodding) So you're completely in the clear on that front, Mary. Nothing to worry about at all.

Mary: (wincing awkwardly) Great.

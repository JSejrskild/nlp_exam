[In the Quinn kitchen, after the funeral. Erin, Orla, Gerry, Mary and Sarah sit.]

Granda Joe: (walking over with tea) Not a bad sendoff in the end, I thought.

Sarah: I'm still devastated about Mammy's earrings, Mary. We were so close.

Mary: Well, they're six foot under now, so unless we dig Bridie up again

Sarah: Maybe that's not such a bad

Mary: It is a bad idea, Sarah. It's a very bad idea. I just want to forget the whole thing.

(Erin looks sad.)

Sarah: How's your scoots now, Erin love?

Erin: Aye, they're clearing up, I think.

Sarah: God, it's my worst nightmare. Getting caught out in someone else's house like that.

Gerry: I still don't understand why you had to bring all of your friends in there with you.

Erin: I panicked, Daddy.

Mary: Can we please stop talking about Erin's scoots? We're about to have our tea.

Granda Joe: Oh, I meant to say, I had one of these scones at the wake, and, honest to God, I've never tasted anything like it.

(Erin looks worried. Granda Joe sets a plate of scones on the table.)

Granda Joe: So, I bagged us up a couple.

Sarah: Lovely.

(Orla enthusiastically takes a scone.)

Orla: Happy days.

(Sarah takes a scone.)

Gerry: Don't mind if I do.

(Gerry takes a scone.)

Mary: (holding out her plate) Pass us one, there, would you Erin?

(Erin looks distraught as she stares at the plate.)

[Time lapse.]

Erin: Wise up, Mammy! As if a polar bear's going to rock up at a Take That concert!

Orla: He wouldn't get a ticket, for a start. They sold out months ago.

Mary: You'd be surprised, girls.

Granda Joe: Aye, thon boys would get in where draughts wouldn't.

Gerry: Sure, the concert's nowhere near the zoo.

Granda Joe: But he's not in the zoo anymore, is he, simple Simon? He's sauntering about Belfast without a care in the world.

Sarah: Aye, keep up, Gerry.

Gerry: What I'm saying is that it would be quite a lot of ground for him to cover.

Mary: They're quick on their feet when they want to be, love.

Orla: Or someone might give him a lift.

Erin: Whose side are you on, Orla?

Michelle: Come on, Mary. If you won't let Erin go, our Mas won't let us go.

Mary: Well, neither they should! And I'll be ringing them to say as much.

(Michelle looks annoyed.)

Clare: (frantic) Oh, brilliant!

James: I hate my life.

Mary: Look girls, I know how much you were looking forward to seeing This and That.

Erin: Take That!

Mary: But there'll be other concerts.

Erin: No there won't! The fact that this one's happening is a miracle. Nobody good ever comes here 'cause we keep killing each other!

Sarah: And now we're overrun with polar bears.

Granda Joe: Where will it end?

Erin: Seriously?!

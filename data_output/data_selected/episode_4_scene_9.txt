[In Eamonn's living room.]

Uncle Colm: And, now, I don't mind a bit of a breeze, if anything I prefer it, but thon was aggressive.

(Sister Michael stares painfully at Colm as he tells her his story.)

Uncle Colm: So, I says to myself, says I, Colm, this is no day for a do

Sister Michael: What's happening?

Uncle Colm:  for, when the bride arrived, and, as I say, by this stage the wind was fierce

Sister Michael: Am I dead?

Uncle Colm: I've never heard wind like it.

Sister Michael: Is this my wake?

Uncle Colm: Howling like a banshee, it was.

Sister Michael: Am I in hell?

Uncle Colm: So, the poor girl, the bride now, this is, she arrives anyway and isn't she no sooner out of the car than she's lifted up in the air like a paper doll, and blown into a flowerbed.

Sister Michael: (smiling thoughtfully) That's actually quite funny.

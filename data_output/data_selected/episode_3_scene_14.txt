[In the Quinn kitchen. All the mothers sit at the table, drinking tea.]

Deidre: My Michelle's going to be wishing she was mauled to death by that thing when I get my hands on her.

Geraldine: I don't know what to do anymore. I mean, they say that all teenagers are a bit rebellious, but Clare's off the scale. She's basically a delinquent.

Sarah: (drinking her tea with a spoon) Have you considered adoption, Geraldine?

Geraldine: She's sixteen, Sarah. Sure, she's past the cut-off.

(Gerry is watching TV by himself in the living room.)

News reporter: And finally, amazing scenes in the King's Hall this evening, as the British pop sensations, Take That play their first ever Northern Irish concert.

(Footage of Robbie onstage.)

Mary: Look, girls, we just need some cold, hard proof they went to that concert. And then, by Christ, they won't know what's hit them.

(The kids appear on the TV, in the front row dancing and screaming with excitement.)

(Gerry looks taken aback, and continues watching.)

(Close up of Erin dancing on the TV.)

(Gerry smiles and chuckles. He continues watching his daughter in silence.)

(The kids look happy as they continue dancing at the concert.)

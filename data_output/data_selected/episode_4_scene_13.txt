[In the bathroom. The kids are crowded around the toilet, throwing scones in.]

Michelle: I can't believe we're doing this. It's fucking heartbreaking! (she smells one)

Erin: Look, Granda's had one and now he's acting really, really weird.

Michelle: You're being paranoid, Erin.

Erin: He was nice to Daddy.

Michelle: (alarmed) Jesus!

Erin: Exactly. And if my ma starts asking questions

Michelle: Your ma won't trace it back to us.

Erin: Are you for real? She traces everything back to us! She traces things we haven't even done back to us!

Clare: Are you sure this'll work?

(Orla eats part of a scone.)

James: This is how you get rid of drugs, Clare. I've seen Goodfellas, like, twenty times.

Orla: Naw, it's not the only way. I watched this film once about this girl who was trying to hide drugs and what she did was, she shoved them right up her

(Clare looks disgusted.)

Michelle: I'm not sticking a scone up my hole, Orla. I'll tell you that for nothing.

Clare: Okay, I'm gonna flush.

Erin: Go for it!

(Clare flushes.)

Erin: Is it working?!

James: Of course it's working.

Clare: Is the water rising?!

Erin: Jesus Christ! Why's the water rising, James?

James: I don't know! The water didn't rise in Goodfellas!

Michelle: Fuck! We've clogged it!

Orla: Who has a plunger?

Erin: I'm afraid I left the house without my plunger tonight, Orla.

Orla: Aye, me too. Nightmare, so it is.

(The water fills the toilet. The kids all shout and jump back.)

[In the Quinn bathroom. Erin is in the bath, talking to herself.]

(Orla opens the door.)

Orla: She's up here!

Erin: Jesus Christ!

Orla: She's pretending she's on Parkinson again.

Mary: (from downstairs) Parkinson?! Does she know what time it is?! I'll Parkinson her! I've enough on my plate without Parkinson!

Erin: Close the door!

(Orla walks in, and closes the door.)

Erin: No Orla. Leave, then close the door.

(Orla looks offended. She leaves and closes the door.)

Erin: (shouting) And it was Wogan, for your information!

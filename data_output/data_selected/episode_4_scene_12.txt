[In the room with the dead body. Sarah and Mary stand over it.]

Mary: After all was said and done, she wasn't a bad oul soul. I was actually quite fond of her, you know. And I really hope she's up there now, looking down on us both, thinking What in under Christ?!

Sarah: Aye, me too, Mary.

Mary: No, Sarah. Look! The earrings. Look at the earrings!

Sarah: God, aye. I wouldn't have put a drop on her, now, she doesn't have enough neck. She'd have been better with a stud.

Mary: They're Mammy's. She's wearing Mammy's earrings!

Sarah: So they are! How did she get them?!

Mary: She probably swooped in like a vulture before Mammy drew her last breath. And now the oul bitch (turns to make sure no one's at the door)  is getting buried in them! Has the woman no shame?!

Sarah: Earrings like that don't deserve to be buried alive! It's a sin!

Mary: She is doing this to spite us, you know.

Sarah: What should we do?

Mary: I don't know.

Sarah: (whispering) We could replace them with exact replicas.

Mary: Right. We don't have exact replicas is the thing, though.

Sarah: That's true enough, Mary, true enough.

23,"Michelle, Erin, Clare, James, Orla, Jon and Orla are going to a boy's party. Erin is not sure about it. James tells her to be confident and not be a blowfish. Michelle tells Erin to be sexy.","[In Erin’s bedroom. Erin is putting on a dress. Orla is doing her hair. Clare peeks in.]

1. Clare: Erin, you really think you should wear *that* to a boy’s party?

2. Erin: Better than looking like a blowfish, Clare. (frowns at her dress in the mirror)

3. James: (from the doorway) Confidence, Erin! Be bold like a hawk, not stiff like a blowfish.

4. Orla: Ew, James. Nobody wants to be a blowfish.

5. Erin: I’m not sure I want to go, though. A boy’s party sounds… weird.

6. Michelle: Weird? Erin, boy’s party = opportunity. Opportunity to be *sexy*. (strikes a pose)

7. Erin: Sexy? Mum, I’m thirteen. If I try to be sexy, I'll look ridiculous.

8. Michelle: Ridiculous sells, sweetheart. Sometimes ridiculous is the look.

9. Clare: Look, just be yourself. Unless you’re a blowfish. Then pick a look.

10. Orla: And if you're going to be sexy, wear red. Red distracts the eye from bad dancing.

11. James: (rolls his eyes) Are we styling Erin or sending her to battle?

12. Erin: I just don’t want to regret it later. What if I spill something everywhere?

13. Michelle: Spill? Then you’ll clean it up, or someone else will.

14. Jon: (knocks and enters) Hey, girls. You're all ready?

15. Erin: I think so. Or I’m somewhere between sexy and sensible.

16. Jon: That’s perfect. No one notices sensible anyway, Erin. Go with the sexy.

17. James: See? Jon gets it. Confidence, eye contact, smile. Not blowfish.

18. Erin: (sighs) Fine. Eye contact. Smile. And maybe red lips.

19. Orla: Don’t let any boys see your diary tonight either. That’s reserved for your enemies.

20. Clare: Enemy? Who needs enemies when you’ve got siblings?

21. James: Erin, promise me one thing—you’ll dance even if it feels silly.

22. Erin: Promise. (takes a deep breath, fixes her dress) Let’s go make a memory, not a mannequin.

23. Michelle: That’s my girl. Now—smart phone... red lips... strut out that door!"
15,Clare hasn't said a word since last night. James is wearing his pink waterproof trousers. He did it for a laugh. Erin and Michelle want to swap Harry.,"[In the Quinn living room. Clare sits silent on the couch, looking down. James stands nearby in bright pink waterproof trousers, grinning. Erin and Michelle whisper to each other.]

Erin: (whispering, to Michelle) Do you think James knows how much he looks like a… a flaming flamingo?

Michelle: (stifling laughter) I’m not sure. He seems proud of it.

James: (joining in) Come on! These trousers are waterproof. I could stomp through a flood and still keep my dignity.

Erin: Dignity? In pink that loud? I’d hear you from the moon, lad.

Mary: (offstage, calling) Michelle! Erin! Why are you two sneaking around like you're planning a bank heist?

Michelle: (boldly) Mammy, we want to swap Harry.

Mary: Swap Harry? What are you on about?

Erin: Harry from Friends Across the Barricades. You know, Michelle’s crush.

Michelle: We figured if Erin gets Harry, I get... well, someone else.

Mary: (exasperated) You can’t just swap people like you swap sandwiches!

James: (poking in) What about me? Am I part of this trade?

Erin: (ignoring him) Clare, you’re not talking. You’re not even blinking. What’s wrong?

[Clare lifts her head slowly. She opens mouth to speak.]

Erin: Speak, Clare. We can’t make plans in the dark.

Clare: (softly) I…I heard everything last night.

[Silence. Erin and Michelle exchange a look.]

Michelle: (concerned) About Harry?

Clare: About you all… about everything.

[In the pause, James stands firm, pink trousers glinting under lights. Erin looks torn; Michelle hopes.]

Erin: Then we need to talk. All of us together. This swapping nonsense stops unless everyone's okay.

Mary: (entering room) Finally, some sense returning.

[Scene ends.]"
20,The Child of Prague statue that the Bishop gifted to Our Lady Immaculate College was passed around the Derry Diocese. Sister Patrick has left the school for a missionary work in Belfast. Ms. De Brn is the new English teacher.,"[In the school corridor. Erin and Orla are waiting outside their English classroom. Erin clutches a small prayer card.]

ERIN: I still can’t believe the Statue of the Child of Prague is here in school. Did you hear Ms. De Brn got it from the Bishop himself?

ORLA: Aye—just passed around the Derry Diocese like a holy hot potato.  

ERIN: It’s supposed to bring good luck. Maybe it’ll bless my essays, finally.

ORLA: Or maybe Ms. De Brn will use it as a punishment. “Miss a comma, thou shalt not pass.”

(Ms. De Brn opens the door.)

MS. DE BRN: Good morning, girls. Hope you’re ready for English—today we begin poetry.

ERIN: Morning, Ms. De Brn. Will the Child of Prague help us with rhymes, do you think?

MS. DE BRN: Possibly. But I expect you to work as hard as if you were standing in front of him.

ORLA: Even if we mess up, he might forgive us?

MS. DE BRN: With enough effort, yes. But I’m not a saint.

(They enter classroom; Sister Michael is inside placing the statue on a shelf.)

SISTER MICHAEL: Classes are about to begin. I’d like to remind everyone Sister Patrick will not be returning—her missionary work in Belfast starts next week.

ERIN (whispering to Orla): That’s where all the drama is, right?

ORLA: Belfast... the big leagues of trouble.

MARY: (offstage, calling through window) Erin! Don’t forget your blazer! And who’s taking care of the Child of Prague during Georgina’s lockdown?

GERRY: (following Mary) I saw him—statue’s safe. Sister Michael’s minding him.

ERIN: Thank God. I couldn't live with myself if the Bishop got word that we lost his Baby Jesus.

MS. DE BRN: Now, for today’s poem: explore injustice. Compare your knee-jerk reactions to suffering—Saints, statues, and school alike.

ORLA: (to Erin) This’ll be good. Maybe I’ll write about that time Mammy banned us from the bridge.

ERIN: That, and how Sister Declan died... except almost ninety-eight didn’t stop us freaking out.

MS. DE BRN: Excellent material. You two—pull up chairs. And remember—violence is less helpful than understanding. Even for statuary."
17,"Erin is writing a love story for her partner. She is frustrated that she has to explain the meaning of the word ""bide"" to Michelle and James.","[In Erin’s bedroom. Erin sits at her desk, writing in a notebook. Michelle knocks and enters.]

Michelle: What’re you writing, Erin?

Erin: It’s a love story... for someone special.

[James slips in behind Michelle.]

James: Ah, romance! Are you going to read it out loud?

Erin: Not yet. I just used a word and they’re asking me what it means.

Michelle: Which word? Is it one of those posh words like “beguile” or something?

Erin: No—it’s “bide.” I wrote: “He will bide with her until dawn.”

Michelle: Bide...? What does that even mean? Stay? Wait?

Erin: Exactly, sort of. “Bide” means to stay somewhere or remain somewhere for a time… to wait.

James: So like when Dad says he’ll bide till the craic’s over before going home?

Erin: Yes, James, exactly like that—but in a romantic way, not your da’s pub habits.

[Mary sticks her head in the door.]

Michelle: Mam, can you help? What does “bide” mean?

Mary: “Bide” is like when you wait for something good—you don’t rush it. You stay patient, you hope.

Erin: Thank you, Mam. Finally someone gets it.

James: So in your story, the lad bides with the lass because he’s waiting for love, not because he’s stuck?

Erin: Precisely! Get your brains in gear, James.

Michelle: Right, now I understand. Go on, read more!"
28,"Erin, James, Michelle, Orla and Clare have just known Ms. De Brn for two days and they love her. She invited them to her house at night.","[Evening. De Brún’s living room. Soft lamplight. Erin, James, Michelle, Orla, and Clare sit on a worn couch and armchairs. De Brún enters with tea tray.]

De Brún: (smiling) Here we are. Hot tea and biscuits. Nothing too fancy—just us.

Erin: (accepting cup) Thanks, Ms. De Brún. This is lovely.

Clare: This house feels so warm. Like it’s breathing.

Michelle: I like your curtains, Ms. De Brún. They’re purple—but not too scary purple.

James: (peeking at photos on mantelpiece) Who’s that man in the sailing boat?

De Brún: That’s my father. He loved boats. Used to take me out every summer.

Orla: You’re lucky. My grandma once took me on a paddleboat. I almost drowned.

Erin: Orla! You’re always dramatic.

Orla: A little drama is good. It keeps the heart beating.

De Brún: (laughs) Would anyone like more tea? Or perhaps some hot chocolate?

Michelle: Hot chocolate, please! With marshmallows if you have them.

James: Yes! Marshmallows are essential to any evening.

Clare: I’ll have tea, thank you.

Erin: Hot chocolate for me too.

[De Brún pours drinks, handing them out.]

De Brún: So, tell me honestly—what do you like about me so far?

Erin: (considering) You’re... different. You listen.

Michelle: And you don’t always punish us. You talk.

James: You laugh. And sometimes you let us choose the music.

Orla: You don’t judge. Even when we fight, you don’t take sides. That’s nice.

De Brún: (quietly) Thank you. That means more than you know.

Clare: It’s weird—just two days. Feels like I’ve always known you.

Erin: Me too. I was braced for lectures, uniforms, rules. Instead, you let us be.

[Door creaks. De Brún pauses.]

De Brún: Shall I put on some music?

Erin: Yes! Something rock or Gaelic or—

Michelle: Anything but funeral dirge.

Orla: (grinning) Or opera. Let opera surprise us!

[De Brún presses play; gentle guitar strumming begins. The room softens.]

De Brún: There, just some acoustic folk. Thought it might suit the moment.

James: It suits. Feels… peaceful.

Erin: (raising her mug) To new beginnings. And to you, Ms. De Brún.

Everyone: To Ms. De Brún.

[They clink mugs. Music plays. Moments of comfortable silence.]

Clare: Will we do this again? Night at yours?

De Brún: Of course, Clare. My door’s always open.

Erin: (smiling) Then tonight, I think I just found a home away from home.

De Brún: And I’m honored to share it with all of you."
17,Clare was at Ms. De Brn's house at night. She was drunk. Jenny Joyce and Erin are on the street.,"[On a dimly lit Belfast street late at night. Erin and Jenny Joyce are standing outside a house, waiting.]

1. Jenny Joyce: Do you think she’s okay in there, Erin?

2. Erin: (frowning) She stank of drink when I left her. I don’t know about okay, Jes.

3. Jenny Joyce: Maybe she just needed to get away. Ms. De Brn’s place has a fire in the fireplace. Warm.

4. Erin: Warm’s one thing. But her tears were warm too. Real hot.

5. Jenny Joyce: (scoffs) You and Clare, you two are cut from the same cloth, Erin. Reckless, stubborn.

6. Erin: Reckless? Maybe. But I won’t just leave her to sober up alone in someone else’s house.

7. Jenny Joyce: What if Ms. De Brn kicks us out? She’s strict about visitors this late.

8. Erin: Better kicked out than worrying ourselves sick. Come on.

[They both approach the front door. Erin lifts her fist to knock.]

9. Erin: (shouts) Clare! You in there? It’s Erin!

10. (Silence. A faint giggle comes from inside.)

11. Jenny Joyce: She’s laughing, Jen. That ain’t a good thing.

12. Erin: (voice shaking) Clare… open up. Jaysus, you’re scaring me.

13. (Door creaks. Clare appears in the doorway, dishevelled, eyes red.)

14. Clare: Erin. Jes. Don’t come in. I’m fine.

15. Erin: You’re not fine. You’re swaying like a lamppost in wind.

16. Claire: It’s just the drink talking. I’ll sleep it off.

17. Jenny Joyce: Then we’ll be right here till you sober up. We’ve got mad notions of responsibility now, Erin.

[Erin places a steadying arm around Clare’s shoulder as Jenny Joyce looks on anxiously.]"
21,Ms. De Brn is no longer in the class. Sister Michael will be taking this class for the rest of the term.,"[Scene: The Quinn kitchen. Orla is at the table doing homework. Erin bursts in, backpack slung over shoulder. Mary is brewing tea. Granda Joe is sitting reading the paper.]

Erin: Mammy! Did you hear? Sister Michael’s taking our class now – for the rest of the term!

Mary: (startled) What? Is that proper?

Orla: (without looking up) Oh great. More nuns. As if one wasn’t enough.

Erin: I thought Ms. De Brn was harsh but—Sister Michael sings hymns in detention now. Hymns!

Granda Joe: Aye, but she might be better than that old git Ms. De Brn, God rest her soul.

Mary: Let’s not speak ill of the gone, Gerald.

[Cut to: Classroom. Sister Michael at the front, chalk in hand. Students murmur. Erin and Clare sit together.]

Sister Michael: Settle down, children. As you know, I will be teaching you for the rest of the term.

Clare: (whispering to Erin) Any idea where Ms. De Brn’s gone?

Erin: Dunno. Probably politics. Or hiding from us lot.

Sister Michael: Today’s lesson is poetry. I want each of you to write about something you care deeply about.

Orla: (in thought) Conflict? Identity? The bridge? Bombs?

Erin: (leans over) Don’t you dare write about bombs again. I’ve done enough trauma.

Sister Michael: Erin, your voice is important. If you want to write about bombs, write about your truth.

[Back in kitchen: Mary wiping a teacup. Gerry enters, looking dishevelled.]

Gerry: What chaos in there? I swear the school sounded like a cathedral full of banshees.

Mary: That’s Sister Michael for you. She’s moved mountains in that class already.

Granda Joe: (smirks) Mountains, or hymns. Same thing to my ears.

Gerry: Sure, at least there’s no Ms. De Brn lurking behind every desk, breathing down their necks.

Mary: Let’s hope this Sister Michael doesn’t go all Ms. De Brn on them.

[Back in classroom.]

Erin: (writing) …“In the silence between bombs I hear hope…” No, too lofty.

Sister Michael: Beautiful, Erin. Don’t censor your heart.

Orla: (quietly) Maybe this term won’t be such a disaster after all.

[Erin glances at Orla, slightly moved.]

Erin: (softly) Maybe not."
19,The kids walk with their bags. They need to go south-east for 0.5 miles and will receive further instructions shortly.,"[Outside Erin’s house. Erin and Orla are each shoulder-strapping backpacks. Morning light.]

Erin: Are you sure there’s no breakfast first?

Orla: There’s a banana in my bag. Your Ma made the toast.

Erin: Fine. (slings bag) South-east for half a mile, she said. Then wait. More instructions.

Orla: Why south-east though? Why not just go east?

Erin: She’s always fancied compass points. Learned them during the Troubles, she says.

[They step off the porch and begin walking down the lane.]

Mary: (from doorway) Girls! Did you pack enough socks?

Erin: (calling back) Socks are in, Ma! And two bottles of water.

Mary: Good. And stay together. Whatever comes next.

Orla: (quietly) Erin, what if the instructions are stupid?

Erin: We’ll make them less stupid. That’s what we’re good at.

[They round the corner and head along a narrow road toward south-east.]

Orla: I hate marches like this. All this walking and nobody telling you when it's going to end.

Erin: Think of it like a treasure hunt. With imminent danger.

Orla: That’s ___ comforting.

[They walk past a row of closed shops, bags heavy on shoulders.]

Erin: Half a mile isn’t far. Shouldn’t take more than ten minutes.

Orla: And then?

Erin: Then we wait. Maybe messages. Maybe people. Whoever.

Orla: Promise we’ll go home if it gets mad dangerous?

Erin: I promise. Nothing’s worth risking you.

Orla: Thanks. (smiles) Now hurry up—I’m lagging behind.

[They continue walking, fading into the quiet street as the sky lightens.]"
19,"Dennis is out of stock of a present for Protestants. Clare, Erin, Michelle, Orla, James and Erin want him to give them the Subbuteo and pay them off in instalments.","[In Dennis’s front room. Erin, Clare, Michelle, Orla, and James are gathered; Erin holds a half-empty Subbuteo box.]

Erin: Dennis! Where’s the rest of the Subbuteo set you promised for Protestants?

Dennis: I’m sorry—out of stock. They’ve none left in Belfast, Derry—nowhere.

Clare: Out of stock?! You told us you had it yesterday!

Michelle: Yeah. And I’ve been counting on that magic midfield player since yesterday.

James: You promised instalments, too—now I’ve spent my pocket money on nothing but promise.

Orla: Instalments, instalments—they sound just like a loan shark in shiny shoes, but we’ll take it.

Erin: So what do we do? Keep waiting? You’ll buy it, or…?

Dennis: I could find a similar set from a second-hand shop but it won’t be official.

Clare: Official? Dennis, we don’t need fancy. We need Subbuteo. Protestants won’t care if it’s chipped.

Orla: As long as we can pretend it’s new at school.

James: And we still get the players in the right kits, right? No funny colours.

Dennis: Maybe. But it'll cost more. I can give you the instalment plan—half now, half later.

Erin: Fine. I’ll take half now. Michelle?

Michelle: Half now for me too. Clare? You okay with late payment?

Clare: I’ll scrape together what I can. Work at the shop this weekend.

Orla: I can help too—babysit Mrs. McCall’s dog. Any dog-sitting counts as Subbuteo fund.

James: Right. When are we paying you the rest, Dennis?

Dennis: Two weeks. Okay? Two weeks and the rest is due.

Erin: And you get us the boxes then?

Dennis: If I can. If they’re back in stock.

Orla: If not, you find another way. We’ll not be out-played.

Erin: Right. Deal.

(All nod, some reluctantly clutching coins, others sharing hopeful glances.)

[They disperse, Erin lingering, staring at Dennis.]

Erin: Thanks, Dennis. And don’t let us down. I’ve got dreams of scoring on Rory Crawford.

Dennis: I’ll not let you down, Erin. I promise.

(Erin exits; Dennis sighs, glances at the empty space once occupied by the Subbuteo set.)"
29,Jenny and Aisling are going to buy a present for the Protestants. Jenny is good friends with a half-Protestant girl whose name's Zara and she has a horse.,"[In Jenny’s bedroom. Aisling is rummaging through Jenny’s wardrobe.]

Jenny: What are you doing, Aisling?

Aisling: Trying to find something decent to wear. If we’re going to the shops to pick out a present for the Protestants, I’m not going looking like this.

Jenny: It doesn’t have to be fancy, just respectful. Zara’ll be coming with us.

Aisling: Half-Protestant, yeah? Doesn’t that count?

Jenny: It does. But you know her Mam likes tradition. We’ll need something that says “peace offering,” not “you’re culture’s crap.”

[They head downstairs. Jenny’s Mam, Siobhan, is making tea.]

Siobhan: You off to the shops?

Jenny: We are, Mam. We’re buying a present. For Zara’s Protestant part of the family.

Siobhan: (sips tea) Bridging the divide, are we?

Aisling: Something like that. Jenny’s being very grown up.

Jenny: She’s good friends with Zara. And her horse—Donny—he’d love treats too. Maybe we get something horsey.

Siobhan: Just stay away from anything that’ll start an argument, girls.

[On the street. Jenny and Aisling, walking. Zara meets them, tied to her horse Donny under a hedge.]

Zara: Hey! Ready to shop?

Jenny: Aye. We thought maybe stable stuff for Donny. And something for you and your family.

Aisling: But not too “Protestant,” or they’ll think we’re mocking them.

Zara: My Dad likes oak things. Protestant or not, he loves woodwork.

Jenny: Oak. Good. Solid.

[They reach the market. Wooden crafts stall.]

Aisling: Look at that, oak photo frame.

Jenny: Could put a picture of Zara and Donny in it.

Zara: I have that photo! (Pulls out phone) It’s lovely.

Vendor: Ah, you girls need help deciding?

Jenny: Yes please. Something meaningful.

Vendor: Perhaps this oak bread board—solid, handmade. Symbol of unity, sharing.

Aisling: That could work.

Zara: That’d be perfect for their kitchen.

Jenny: And Donny? What about some carrots?

Vendor: (smirks) Not with me, lass. But there’s a feed stall just down.

Jenny: Right. Let’s get this board, and pick up carrots after.

[They pay, board wrapped. Exit stall.]

Aisling: I think your Dad will like it, Zara.

Zara: And Donny will be nobbled with joy.

Jenny: See? Peace and carrots. Maybe this is what ‘Friends Across the Barricades’ really means.

Aisling: (smiling) Exactly. A gift, a horse, some hope.

[They walk off, Jenny carrying the oak board, Zara leading Donny.]

Zara: Thank you, Jenny. This means a lot.

Jenny: Anytime. Let’s go get Donny’s treats then.

Aisling: And maybe a cuppa after?

Jenny: You read my mind."
21,"Sister Michael, Jenny, Aisling and Michelle are getting off the bus. The Protestant bus has arrived. The headmistress and the Protestant boys get off in a single file. Sister Michael meets Miss Taylor, who is a Catholic. ","[Outside school gates. Sister Michael, Jenny, Aisling and Michelle are stepping off a Catholic school bus.]

Michelle: Did you see that one with the bright hair?

Aisling: Shh! You’ll get Sister Michael in trouble.

Jenny: Relax, it’s just a scratch of colour. Makes life interesting.

Sister Michael: Girls, straighten your uniforms. We walk in dignity even when chaos looms.

[The Protestant bus pulls up. Headmistress and Protestant boys disembark in a single file.]

Protestant Boy 1: Morning, Sister.

Protestant Boy 2: Good day, ma’am.

Headmistress: We trust you had a safe journey.

Sister Michael: Indeed. God’s peace be with you all.

[Miss Taylor emerges from the Protestant bus line, neatly dressed.]

Miss Taylor: Sister Michael, lovely to see you this morning.

Sister Michael: Miss Taylor, you’re looking well.

Miss Taylor: Thank you. Always a pleasure to greet kind faces before the day begins.

Jenny: (whispering to Aisling) She always smells of lavender, doesn’t she?

Aisling: More like lily-of-the-valley. Lavender makes me sneeze.

Michelle: Who cares, as long as she doesn’t make us do extra homework.

Miss Taylor: How are the girls? Jenny, Aisling, Michelle?

Jenny: Fine, Miss Taylor. Just about ready for another glorious day in holy captivity.

Miss Taylor: (smiling) Well phrased.

Sister Michael: We will teach them not just lessons from books, but lessons of compassion.

Headmistress: A noble endeavour, Sister Michael. Diocese business calls—boys, carry on.

[Protestant boys file off towards their building.]

Sister Michael: Miss Taylor, after school?

Miss Taylor: I should like that very much."
17,"Rita ordered Michelle, Erin and Clare to move a dead sheep. Rita is back in the van, drinking beer and watching the girls happily. Erin is scared of Rita and doesn't want to help. Michelle, Clare and James decide to make James do it.","[Outside on a farm track. A dead sheep lies on the ground. Rita is perched in the back of a rusty van, sipping a beer. Michelle, Erin, Clare, and James stand nearby.]

1. Rita: (yells from van) Right! Get that bleedin’ sheep in the trailer! And I want it done before sundown!

2. Erin: (backs away) No way, Rita. I’m not touchin’ that thing. It’s… it’s horrible.

3. Clare: Erin, stop being dramatic. It’s just a sheep. Dead, yes, but just a sheep.

4. Michelle: Erin’s not moving, Rita. We’ll need someone else on it.

5. James: (gulps) Me? I’m only six, Michelle! I’m too small!

6. Rita: (shouts) Don’t care how old you are, James. Pick it up. I paid good money for this trailer.

7. Erin: (to Clare) You do it then. You love animals so much on Instagram, Clare. Put your hands where your mouth is.

8. Clare: Erin, that’s not fair. I’ll pass on stroking sheep corpses today.

9. Michelle: Look, everybody’s frozen. James, you'll do it. Two hands under its belly, drag while Clare pushes from the back.

10. James: (wobbles closer) Alright… but it smells awful. Rita, you ought to see this!

11. Erin: (nervous, backing further) And if I faint, Rita? What happens then?

12. Rita: (laughs) Then you wake up, Erin. Now MOVE!

13. Clare: Come on, James, I’ll help with the pushing. Erin, you can be the spotter — stand behind so you’re not too near the gore.

14. Erin: (reluctantly steps back) Fine. I’ll be … the spotter. But I’m warning you – if I see even a bit of wool, I might puke.

15. Michelle: That’s the spirit. Now one… two… three! (James and Clare hoist the sheep)

16. Rita: (from van, raising her beer) That’s it! Good lads and lassie. Happy now?

17. James: (panting) Happy? My arms are gonna fall off. But… yeah. Happy enough, Rita."
27,"Rita, Erin, Clare, Michelle, Orla and Orla are going to a Take That concert. They are arguing whether or not to go back for James, who has the tickets.","[Outside the house. Rita, Erin, Clare, Michelle, Orla are crammed into a car. Music blasts. Everyone excited—except Erin.]

Rita: Are you sure James is going to arrive on time with the tickets?

Erin: He said he’d be here by six. It’s quarter past.

Clare: He promised though. He’s never missed a gig yet.

Michelle: Except that one time when he lost his phone on the bus.

Orla: Yes, but that was different. That phone was practically a brick.

Rita: Well, we can’t just wait here all night. Take That won’t wait for James.

Erin: Maybe we go back. Pick him up.

Clare: What? Drive back through all that traffic just for one lad?

Michelle: Have you seen the queues lately? It’ll add another hour at least.

Orla: But if he doesn’t have the tickets, none of us gets in.

Rita: True. Or someone needs to stay behind. One of us can’t miss out.

Erin: I’ll stay. I can try talking them into letting me in without a ticket.

Clare: You think that’s going to work? With security?

Michelle: I’d volunteer, but I’ve got Mum’s fancy shoes and they’ll be ruined.

Orla: I could stay. I’m already in my trainers.

Rita: No—look, we split. Half go on to the venue. Half stay and fetch James.

Erin: That’s madness. We leave you lot alone? You’ll never make it in time.

Clare: And what if James is driving? We’ll be stuck without him.

Michelle: Unless he phones... Oh wait, battery’s probably dead.

Orla: We could text until the phone dies.

Rita: Decision time. We either go back now or gamble.

Erin: I say we gamble. We can’t lose much.

Clare: We’ll lose the best view, that’s what.

Michelle: And maybe the chance to scream when they hit “Back for Good”.

Orla: Exactly. It’s the chorus. The best chorus.

Rita: Erin, Clare, Michelle—you're sure you want to risk it?

Erin: Yes. Yes, gamble.

Clare: Aye, gamble.

Michelle: Fine by me.

Orla: (sighs) If you lot are going on ahead, I’ll stay behind with Rita to get James.

Rita: Right. We’ll drive off in five. Those going ahead—stay close to the stage.

Erin: Deal. Best of luck, Rita.

Clare: Don’t mess this up, James.

Michelle: We’ll see you at the gate if not inside.

24,James is helping the gypsies. Michelle wants him to get in the van. James is not leaving. James and Jonjo are arguing.,"[Outside near the lane. A battered white van with ROMANIAN GYPSIES around it, packing belongings. James is helping lift blankets and crates. Michelle runs up panting.]

Michelle: James! Jesus, just get in the van, for God’s sake!

James: I’m not getting in any van. I'm helping these folks move their things, fair play.

Michelle: You heard what Jonjo said—he needs you behind the wheel before the crossroads, or we’ll be stopped.

Jonjo: (calling) You’re dawdlin’, lad! Ain’t got all day!

James: I’m busy! These gypsies asked for help—who am I to turn away?

Michelle: You’re my brother! And you promised me you’d protect us from trouble—not bring more.

James: Helping people ain’t trouble. It’s kindness. Something you’ve forgotten.

Jonjo: (stepping in) Kindness won’t stop the Garda checkpoint, will it? You think they’ll say “thanks for lending a hand”?

Michelle: Exactly! (turns to James) Every minute here’s risk.

James: (firm) I’ll risk it. They lost everything in the fire. And now you ask me to abandon them?

Michelle: They’re strangers, James. What about our safety? What about our future?

James: Our future is built on what we do now—if we abandon people now, we’ll regret it forever.

Jonjo: (losing patience) You’ll let sentry dogs tear apart the back of the van while you argue poetry?

Michelle: Stop talking in riddles, James! Get in that driver’s seat before—

James: No. I won’t. Not until everyone is safe inside. All of them.

Michelle: (exasperated) You’re impossible.

Orla: (walking out from house) What’s all the shouting?

Erin: Sounds like James is making a speech again.

Michelle: Orla, Erin, stay back. This is serious.

Erin: Serious or stupid? One word away between each, sometimes.

Jonjo: Look, Erin, Orla—help me load the last crate or go inside.

Erin: I ain't lifting crates for smugges.

Orla: Who are smugges?

Erin: Gypsies. Haven’t you ever seen a TV?

James: Enough! (“turns to Michelle”) I know you fear things gone wrong. But I can’t leave them waiting.

Michelle: You can’t stay either! We both could get in trouble.

James: Then we will. But you’ll see—history’ll judge us better for staying than for walking away.

Jonjo: Well, judge away, but you better be ready to drive like you mean it when I say go.

Michelle: (to James) When I say go, do it. No more speeches.

James: I'll be ready. (looks at the gypsies smiling at him) Let’s finish this—together.

[Michelle steps back, Jonjo returns to van, Erin and Orla watch. James lifts final crate.]

Jonjo: That’s the last one.

Michelle: Go. Drive.

James: Hold tight.

24,"Erin, Orla, Michelle, Clare and James are going to the This and That concert. Mary will be calling their parents to let them go.","[In the Quinn kitchen. Erin, Orla, Michelle, Clare and James are stuffing stuff into bags.]

Erin: Right, girls, this is it — This and That concert tonight. I can’t believe we got tickets.

Orla: I’ve packed my good camera. If I don’t get at least one epic crowd shot, I’m returning to poverty.

Clare: And I’ve got enough eyeliner to black out an entire stadium.

James: You do realise I can’t see when you do that, right? I’ll probably trip over wires or something.

Michelle: Oh James, you’ll survive. As long as you don’t end up dragged onstage.

Erin: Just imagine all the banter. All the songs. ALL of it.

Mary: (from offstage) Ladies! What’s the state of this?

[Mary enters, holding her phone.]

Mary: I’ve to ring Gerry and Granda Joe. They need to agree you can go.

Erin: Mammy, you don’t think they’ll say no, do you?

Orla: I promise, we’ll be safe. Clare’s uncle is picking us up from the venue.

Clare: Yes, he has a car! Not one of yours that might fall apart halfway.

James: I’ll be with you the whole time. Pack of us, us five.

Mary: Fine, but I need to ‘sell’ it. They’ll think it’s all noise and bad influence.

Michelle: It’s This and That! It’s cultural enrichment! Music! Good vibrations!

Erin: If you say “good vibrations”, I’ll puke.

[Mary dials phone.]

Mary: Gerry? Hi love. I have a proposition.

Gerry: (voice via phone) What is it this time?

Mary: The girls want to go to a concert tonight — This and That band. Good bunch, Mary says.

Gerry: A concert? At this hour?

Mary: Yes love, I know. But Clare’s uncle will pick them up. James, too. I’ll be there early.

Gerry: (voice) What about Curfew? You’ll bring them home safe?

Mary: Of course. No risks with … noise and crowd.

[Erin exchanges relieved look with Orla, Michelle smiles.]

Gerry: (voice) Right. But tickets cost?

Mary: Already done.

Gerry: (voice) Then sure. Have fun — but I want updates every half hour.

Mary: You’ll get’em.

[Sister Michael’s old radio plays in background.]

Mary: Erin, be in by midnight.

Erin: Midnight. We’ll fly in then. Promise.

Orla: I’ll text if the concert turns into an apocalypse.

James: See you later Mam! Bye Clare! Let’s go tick off some concrete dancing.

[They all grab bags, head to door.]

Clare: Best night ever, you wretched lot.

Michelle: High on music and freedom.

Mary: (smiling) You lot better behave. And bring me back stories, not mess.

Erin: Always, Mam.

[They rush out the door, laughing. Mary watches them go, concerned but proud.]"
19,"Erin, Michelle, James, Clare and Orla are going to the concert. They are afraid of the polar bear but they are determined to go.","[Outside Erin’s house. The gang is gathered at the gate. It’s dusk.]

Erin: Right, is everyone ready? Tickets, phones, shoes—Orla, you got your gum?

Orla: Aye, I’ve got gum. But I’ve still got a bad feeling about that polar bear poster outside the concert hall. It’s huge.

Michelle: It’s only a picture, Orla. Polar bears don’t wander into gigs in Belfast.

James: You never know. Last time I went to a fair, a life-size dinosaur costume chased me.

Clare: Stop exaggerating, James. The polar bear is just part of the light show or something.

Erin: If he moves, I’m legging it. (pauses) But I’m going anyway. Aren’t we all?

Michelle: We are. We’re going. Fear of polar bears won’t stop us. Concert tickets cost money, Erin.

James: My Mum says if I survive the polar bear, I can have ice cream after.

Orla: See? Stakes are high. Very motivational.

Clare: Who’s meeting us at the venue? My Da said he’ll drop me off early.

Erin: I’ll pick you up on the way. Michelle and I are sharing the lift.

Michelle: With James in the backseat, singing half the drive—promise no bears in the back, okay?

James: I’ll behave—unless there’s an impromptu roar.

Orla: Let’s just promise to stick together, aye? If the polar bear show starts, we stay tight.

Erin: Deal. Now let’s go get dressed before the concert starts without us.

Clare: Wait—did anyone bring a jacket? Neon lights are cold.

Michelle: I’ve got Erin’s spare hoodie. Just in case.

Erin: Good—fear of polar bears and cold neon wind, but nothing’s stopping us tonight.

James: To the concert! And to the polar bear—may it stay on the poster.

Orla: (smiling) On the poster, it is. Let’s fly, you lot."

1 Soldier on radio (crackling): “Examining suspect device now. Bomb diffusers… approaching the suitcase.”  
2 Erin (whispering): “A suitcase? What sort of monster leaves a suitcase in front of a school?”  
3 Michelle: “That’s her vodka. She said she was delivering it. Why a bomb?”  
4 James (wide-eyed): “I thought they said it was juice. I hate juice.”  
5 Clare: “This is ridiculous. Someone’s playing games. Like that time Dad lost his trousers to the birds.”  
6 Orla: “This is serious, Clare. Could go off at any moment.”  
7 Roger: “They’re trained. The Army diffusers know what they’re doing.”  
8 Sister Michael: “Keep back, everyone. Follow the barricade. Step away from the windows.”  
9 Soldier on radio: “Device is confirmed. TNT liner detected. We’re safe-stroking it.”  
10 Erin: “What does that even mean, safe-stroking?”  
11 Michelle: “It means they’re trying to disarm it, Erin.”  
12 James: “Maybe it’s like a video game. Hit the right button, it stops.”  
13 Clare: “If this explodes I’ll never tell Mam I cut class again.”  
14 Orla: “Not helping. You’re making it worse.”  
15 Roger: “Lower voice, please. Sister Michael needs calm.”  
16 Sister Michael: “Children, prayer is allowed now.”  
17 Erin: “You want us to pray?”  
18 Sister Michael: “If it brings peace to your hearts, yes.”  
19 Soldier on radio: “Diffusers are in position. Final cuts being made…”  
20 Michelle: “I’m scared.”  
21 James: “Me too. I thought we left this behind.”  
22 Clare: “Bombs and bridges and uniform mansions—”  
23 Orla: “Clare!”  
24 Soldier on radio: “Device disarmed. Vacuum to contain residue. No explosion.”  
25 Erin (exhales): “Thank God. I thought I was going to — I dunno.”

A covered body lies on a bed. On a small table beside it rest a pair of Mammy’s earrings, glittering. Mary and Sarah stand looking at them, tense.]

1. Mary: (softly) God, Sarah… those earrings—are they really hers?  
2. Sarah: (eyes wide) Mammy’s, by the holy water. I recognised the clasp. Didn’t wear them since she got those at Feeney’s fair.  
3. Mary: (swaying) But… what are they doing here, at this… scene? I mean… I shouldn’t be saying this— but it looks bad.  
4. Sarah: Bad? It’s awful, Mary. If anyone sees those earrings—people’ll talk. This is not just grief now, it’s trouble.  
5. Mary: (pacing) We need to put them somewhere safe. Bury them with her? No, that’ll raise questions.  
6. Sarah: Hide them! Lock 'em in your jewellery box, or under the floorboards. Anywhere!  
7. Mary: (hesitates) I'd hate to lose them. She’d kill me if she thought I misplaced them. After everything.  
8. Sarah: Mammy’s sense of ‘losing’—you wouldn’t live through it. She’d have the heavens and earth turned inside out.  
9. Mary: (stops pacing) Maybe… maybe we leave them with Sister Michael? She has no reason to lie about things.  
10. Sarah: And what if she does? Then those earrings—Mammy’s beloved earrings—end up in some official report.  
11. Mary: (kneels, picks up earrings) I can’t— I can’t leave them here, with this… this body.  
12. Sarah: Don’t touch them too much, they’ll tarnish. Mammy loved them shining.  
13. Mary: (places earrings back on table) Right. We’ll come back for them. Once no one's here. Once it’s safe.  
14. Sarah: Safe? In this house? With the rumours flying? With Granda Joe talking to the neighbours?  
15. Mary: (firmly) It’s the only chance we’ve got. Trust me, Sarah. I’ll look after them. Them earrings are Mammy’s pride."

Erin left the house without a plunger.","[In the Quinn house bathroom. Erin, Clare, Orla and Michelle crowded around a clogged toilet. A small bag of pills lay on the floor.]

Erin: For heaven’s sake, someone flush it, quickly!

Clare: Erin, you can’t just chuck the whole lot down—if it’s clogged, we’ll flood the house.

Orla: Erin, where’s the plunger? You know, that red thing we bought.

Erin: I thought I left it by the sink. It’s… it’s not here. I swear, I didn’t take it upstairs.

Michelle: Great. No plunger. And that’s exactly when we need one—now.

Erin: Right, okay. Well, what do we do? We can’t just leave it sitting there, can we?

Clare: Michelle, block the overflow hole. Make sure no water starts coming up.

Michelle: (places hand over overflow's vent) Done. Now what?

Orla: Use the shampoo bottle—pour some soapy water in. Helps lubrication, maybe the blockage will move.

Erin: On it. (She pours shampoo and water into the bowl)

Clare: Is the water level rising?

Michelle: Yes! Erin, stop! It’s halfway up the rim!

Erin: Well, I’m trying something. What about a coat hanger or something rigid to push it through?

Orla: That’s disgusting. But… might work.

Clare: Do you really want us practicing plumbing with a coat hanger? We’ll scratch the porcelain.

Erin: (frustrated) I don’t care! Just push!

Michelle: (takes hanger) Okay… pushing… back and forth… nothing.

Orla: Are you making it worse? Because the water’s getting murkier.

Clare: Erin, open the window at least. Smell is getting bad.

Erin: (opens window) Fresh air—right.

Michelle: We could try boiling water. My mum once cleared a clogged sink that way.

Orla: Toilet, Michelle. Toilet. Boiling water might crack it! Never mind standing here arguing.

Clare: Erin—listen. Maybe the best thing is: leave it. Let gravity do its work overnight.

Erin: And we’re going to sleep with that thing overflowing?

Michelle: No. But we could mop up now, put down towels. When it cools, try again in the morning.

Orla: What about calling someone? Dad? No… Mum?

Erin: Mum will kill us. Dad will lecture us about drugs without asking what they are.

Clare: We just… need time. Let it settle. And tonight, try again.

Michelle: We’ll clean up the mess, stash the bag somewhere safe—just until then.

Erin: Fine. But tomorrow, first thing—new plunger.

Orla: Agreed. And maybe less improvising.

Clare: Right. Let’s clear out. I can’t stay here, I’m getting light-headed.

Erin: Someone grab towels. We’ll mop this swamp up before anyone notices.

Granda Joe: Well, I thought we could all use a bit of comfort. Tea hot, scones warm.  

Mary: Thank you, Joe. You’re always good at this sort of thing.  

Sarah: (breaking a scone apart) Grand, this is lovely. Moist inside — just how I like them.  

Erin: (takes a scone, buttering it) It’s nice not feeling completely hollow inside.  

Orla: (nibbling) Are these the ones you made this morning, Mammy?  

Mary: Aye, before I went to gather everyone.  

Gerry: (pouring tea) There’s nothing like tea to settle the nerves.  

Granda Joe: (sipping) To dear Sister Declan. May she rest easy now.  

Erin: (quietly) Rest easy. I still can’t believe she’s gone.  

Sarah: She was ninety-eight, Erin. Lived a long life.  

Erin: That doesn’t make it easier, Aunt Sarah. Seeing the body, the hush.  

Orla: (softly) I kept thinking I’d wake up and it’d all be a bad dream.  

Mary: It’s okay to feel lost, love. We all are.  

Gerry: We’ll get through this — together.  

Granda Joe: Exactly. Solid as a rock.  

Erin: (bites scone) It’s just — the world feels sharper now.  

Sarah: Sharper how?  

Erin: Like every argument will cut you, every laugh reminds you someone’s gone.  

Orla: (murmurs) I don’t like that feeling.  

Granda Joe: Time will dull it, girls. But memories... they’ll grow stronger.  

Mary: And we remember her good parts. Her stories, her singing, her stubbornness.

17,James won't go to the prom because it clashes with Doctor Who night. Clare was going to ask James to be her date but it's complicated for her as he's a lesbian.,"[In the Quinn living room. Clare is sitting on the sofa, James reading a comic. Erin enters, overhearing them.]

1. Erin: What are you two sulking about?

2. Clare: Nothing, Erin, really.

3. James: Clare wanted to ask me something—but, well, it’s a bit awkward.

4. Erin: Is this about prom?

5. Clare: Yes.

6. James: The prom is the same night as Doctor Who night.

7. Erin: Seriously? That’s tragic.

8. Clare: I was going to ask you to go with me, James.

9. James: I know. I just… I’m a lesbian, Clare. Prom feels like a different kind of asking out.

10. Clare: Right. I didn’t think straight about that. I just thought…

11. James: I know, Clare. And I’m flattered—it’s sweet.

12. Erin: So what’re you going to do?

13. James: I won’t go to prom. I’ll stay home and watch Doctor Who.

14. Clare: I get that. I’m sorry if I made this complicated.

15. Mary (off-stage, calling): Erin! Are you in there? Dinner’s ready!

16. Erin: (loud whisper) I vote Doctor Who night.

17. Clare: Me too—just keep the time open, James.

[They share a small smile as Erin exits to call Mary, Clare and James sit quietly, slightly awkward but closer.]"
19,"Clare, Erin, Michelle, James, Orla and Mae are in a dress shop. Erin likes the pink dress the most, while Orla is torn between the purple and orange jumpsuit and the blue one.","[Inside “Fanciful Frocks” dress shop. Racks of clothes everywhere. Erin, Clare, Michelle, James, Orla, and Mae are browsing.]

Erin: (holding up a pink dress) Look at this one! Mam, this dress is absolutely mine. It screams ME.

Mae: It’s very… pink. Like candy floss pink. Are you sure?

Clare: It's cute on you, Erin. But maybe a bit too candy-flossy?

James: Pink’s good. Shows you mean business—or bubblegum. Depends.

Michelle: Erin, you’ll turn heads in that. I like it.

Orla: (holding two hangers) What about this purple-and-orange jumpsuit versus the blue one here? I can’t pick.

Erin: Go with what makes you feel like Orla, not like a rainbow vomited on you.

Orla: Hey! Rainbow vomit is very in this season… maybe.

Mae: The blue one is classy. The jumpsuit is loud. You’re loud already.

Clare: True. But loud can be lovely. Depends on how you carry it.

Michelle: (to Orla) Try them both on, see which feels better.

James: And whichever gets fewer comments from aunties at Mass, that’s the one.

Orla: (smiling) Okay, Blue first. Then the jumpsuit. I need them both anyway.

Erin: (twirls in pink dress) See? Pink is perfection.

Mae: Erin, slow down or you'll spin yourself dizzy.

Clare: Let’s guess how many people you’ll make jealous in that dress.

Michelle: I vote seven. Seven jealous people.

James: Minimum. At least half of the school.

Orla: (coming out in blue dress) What about this?

Erin: Oh, Orla, you look stunning. The blue suits you more than the rainbow wake-up call.

Michelle: Yes! That one’s a winner.

Orla: (grins) Dress one blue it is. But maybe I’m coming back for the jumpsuit. Just in case."
23,"Mae wants to buy a red dress for prom, but it's been left over for someone else. Jenny took the red one.","[In the McKenna living room. Mae is frantically rummaging through her wardrobe. Mammy sits knitting in a chair.]

Mae: Mammy, where is it? The red dress—my prom dress! I know I left it here.

Mammy: Calm yourself, Mae. You were told to hang it up. It's not fair to lose things in the chaos.

Mae: (yelling) I didn’t lose it! Someone took it. Jenny has it. I saw her in it yesterday.

Mammy: Jenny? Your friend Jenny? Why on earth would she—

Mae: Because she told everyone she loved my dress. And then, Mammy… she wore it. At Mark’s party.

Mammy: Aw, Mae. That’s… somethin’. Did you speak to her?

Mae: (glares) Not yet. I was too mad. Thought I’d come home and it’d be here. But it’s gone.

[Door slams. Jenny enters, carrying a bag.]

Jenny: Hiya, Mae! Thought I’d bring the extra snack for drama club.

Mae: (coldly) Oh. Snacks. Nice of you.

Jenny: What’s wrong?

Mammy: Mae thinks you have her red dress.

Jenny: (shocked) Mae, I—no! I haven’t taken it. I borrowed it for the party, Mammy.

Mae: Borrowed! Without asking! That’s not borrowing, it’s theft.

Jenny: I asked your cousin last week! I was told she’d lend it if I really needed it. I thought it was okay.

Mae: You thought? The dress has my name on the label!

Mammy: Girls, girls. Sit down. Let’s hear the full story.

Jenny: Mae, I did wear it at Mark’s. It fitted great. But I meant to bring it back today. I just… forgot.

Mae: Of course you forgot. Now everyone thinks it’s yours.

Jenny: I’ll take it off if you want.

Mae: No. It wouldn’t fit now. And the sequins fell off.

Mammy: Jenny, go get the dress and show Mae what state it’s in. Be honest.

Jenny: (huffs, walks to Mae’s room) I’ll get it.

Mae: (to Mammy) I should’ve guarded it like a saint.

Mammy: You must learn trust, Mae. But boundaries too.

[Jenny returns, dress in hand. Dress is wrinkled.]

Jenny: Here. I’m sorry. See? Not perfect.

Mae: (examining) It’s a mess. But thanks for bringing it back.

Jenny: I’ll pay to fix the sequins. And I won’t wear it again without asking.

Mae: (softens) Fine. And next time, ask me.

Mammy: That’s all we ask. Promise kept.

Jenny: Promise.

Mae: (sighs) Well, I suppose this means finding a new plan for prom shoes.

Jenny: I can help you pick. Something better than yesterday’s sneakers?

Mae: (smiles reluctantly) Yes. Definitely better than that.

Mammy: That’s my girls. Now pass me that knitting—off we go to hunt for glamour."
29,"Jenny organises the prom. Erin is going with her new friend, Erin's from Donegal. The prom is rigged and Jenny is trying to win it. Erin doesn't need this and decides to skip it.","[At Erin’s kitchen. Erin is pacing; Mary is ironing; Orla is poking at a bowl of porridge.]

1. Erin: I’m telling you, Mammy, Jenny’s up to something with this prom.

2. Mary: What do you mean, Erin?

3. Orla: She means she’s organising it, Mammy. She’s very proud. Like she’s the Queen of the School.

4. Erin: Exactly. And when Jenny gets proud, she does things behind your back—rigs things.

5. Mary: Rigging a prom? That’s a serious claim, girl.

6. Orla: Erin’s new friend—what’s her name again?

7. Erin: Aoife. She’s from Donegal. She says Jenny asked her to vote for Jenny in the prom royal court.

8. Orla: The royal court, Erin? Are we back in medieval times?

9. Erin: Well, that’s how she’s acting. A girl who promised fairness, but there’s whispering in the hallway, promises, bargains…

10. Mary: And Aoife believes Jenny?

11. Erin: She does. But I don’t need this drama, Ma. I’d rather skip the whole thing.

12. Orla: Skip the prom? Erin, your dad paid for the ticket.

13. Mary: I don’t like the sound of Jenny being sly.

14. Erin: It’s not just that—last week, Jenny said she was giving out voting papers fairly. Aoife told me she watched Jenny stuff some extra slips in.

15. Orla: That is sly.

16. Mary: If that’s true, Jenny should be called out. Has anyone seen this?

17. Erin: Aoife saw. Claire saw. But everyone’s scared of Jenny’s crowd.

18. Orla: Why are teenagers always either in a crowd or terrified of one?

19. Mary: Erin, are you certain you want to skip? Wouldn’t it be easier to expose Jenny at the prom?

20. Erin: Maybe. But I don’t want to fight. I just want a night that’s real—to dance, to laugh, not whisper behind veils of votes.

21. Orla: You could use humor—call her bluff in front of everyone.

22. Erin: I don’t need to be prom queen. I need to be me.

23. Mary: That’s right. If Jenny wants a crown, let her have it. But I’ll not see my daughter walking into a trap.

24. [Doorbell rings]

25. Jenny: (outside, calling) Erin! Erin, are you there?

26. Erin: (sighs) She’s here.

27. Jenny: Erin! You coming out?

28. Erin: (opening door) No, Jenny. I’m not going. And I won’t be part of something rigged.

29. Jenny: What? You can’t do that—you’ll look weak—

Erin: Better weak than fake. (Closes door and walks away)"

Line 8  
Mary: What do you mean “they needed you”? For what part of the service?

Line 9  
Bill: I’m supposed to read a passage. Some request from the parish—they said they sent for someone dependable.

Line 10  
Orla: (sniffs) Dependable? More like someone handy to hang onto when the Clintons roll in.

Line 11  
Mary: Well, if the Clintons are coming, we’ll need to be on our best behaviour.

Line 12  
Bill: The dispatcher seemed nervous. Kept mentioning “feeling the air stiff” in Burt.

Line 13  
Erin: Air stiff? Sounds like trouble brewing—politics or otherwise.

Line 14  
Mary: Don’t you go mixing politics with the holy, Erin. Mass isn’t the place.

Line 15  
Orla: Yet they drag us into it all the same—crossfire comes in many garments.

Man: Ladies and gentlemen, it is my greatest honour to introduce—

—the President of the United States of America!

Erin: (elbows James) Is that really him, James? Look at that hair.  

James: I’d know those ears anywhere.  

Clare: (to Michelle) I can’t believe we got tickets!  

Michelle: (smiling nervously) Aye, but you know how these things go—everyone screaming and fainting.  

Bill Clinton: (stepping forward from the crowd, waving) Thank you! Thank you all!

Erin: (gasps) He’s here! Mr. President!  

Bill Clinton: (into microphone) Thank you for welcoming me today.  
I’ve heard tales of Belfast’s spirit, its strength—and its heart.

Clare: Heart. I like hearing that.

Erin: And what about the bombs? What about the bridges?  

Michelle: Erin—shimmy down. You’re embarrassing us.  

James: She has a point though.  

Bill Clinton: We must build more than roads; we build trust.  
We must lift fear off shoulders and let young voices be heard.

Man: (off-camera) Mr. President, your schedule—  

Bill Clinton: I insist this audience stays as long as needs be.  
Change doesn’t come with silence.

Erin: (cheering) Hear, hear!  

Clare: (joins in) Aye! Let them talk!

Michelle: (claps) Well said, sir.

James: Think Mam would believe this if I told her I shook hands with the President?

Bill Clinton: (points toward Erin and James) And you—young people—are the heartbeat of peace.  
Never let anyone tell you you have no power.

Erin: I believe that.  

Clare: Me too.

19,The President of the United States of America is coming to Derry tomorrow. Schools across the city are marking it as a public holiday. Sister Michael is worried that the visit will give the Pope ideas.,"[INT. NOLAN KITCHEN – MORNING]

Erin: Mammy, the whole city’s buzzing—they’re closing schools tomorrow. The President of the United States is coming to Derry.

Mary: What? The President? Here?

Orla: Sure, Erin, who else could they mean? Obama? Trump? Some chap who sells burgers?

Erin: No, Orla—President of the USA. He’ll be visiting. Everything’s shut down.

Gerry: Public holiday, they’re saying. Every school. Mary, have you heard?

Mary: First I hear of it. And just when I found a decent bit of peace!

Granda Joe: And now they’ll crowd the streets, she’ll catch me without a hat—face sunburnt.

Sarah: Can’t be doing with that nonsense. And blocking off the roads and all that.

[INT. SISTER MICHAEL’S OFFICE – LATE MORNING]

Sister Michael: Entrance.

Mary: Morning, Sister Michael. We thought we’d see you about this new holiday business.

Sister Michael: Yes, well. The President coming is... monumental. But I’ve concerns.

Erin: What kind of concerns? Is the Pope visiting after him?

Sister Michael: Exactly my fear, Erin. Give the Pope ideas—next thing you know, rosaries everywhere, extra holy days, masses nonstop.

Granda Joe: That’d upset the balance.

Sarah: Mammy’s already frightened her garden shed will get converted into a chapel.

Mary: Sister Michael, sure we like our faith and all, but I don’t need the church running every minute of the clock.

Sister Michael: It’s about precedent. If we start closing schools for heads of state—

Erin: Mammy, you’ll get a lie in tomorrow!

Mary: Don’t you tempt me.

Orla: (licking spoon) Is there cake for this holiday? You know I celebrate with cake.

[They all look at Sister Michael.]

Sister Michael: I’ll speak to the bishop. Try to keep things under control. But yes—expect grand gestures.

Erin: Grand gestures? Mammy, gran, would you rather see the Pope or the President first?

Mary: Don’t be ridiculous, Erin. Both give me palpitations."

Erin: I’m telling you, she’s gone too far this time. Chelsea thinks she's queen of the school.

Clare: Aye, and we’re the peasants in her court. It’s not fair.

Michelle: She was slaggin’ me in front of everyone yesterday. Said I look like I slept in my uniform.

James: She’s been acting the maggot since the start of term.

Orla: Fine, what are we doing about it? Complaining never worked before.

Erin: We’ll teach her a lesson. A lesson she’ll never forget.

Clare: Are you thinkin’ what I’m thinkin’?

Michelle: Sicknote from Mam? Disappearing to the loo forever?

James: No. Truant.

Orla: You mean… skip school? All of us?

Erin: A protest. We don’t go in. Not one of us. She won’t know what hit her.

James: My Ma’ll kill me.

Clare: She won’t know where I am, anyway. Trust me, I’ve got it sorted.

Michelle: And what about homework? Teachers notice absence.

Erin: We’ll tell ‘em we’re sick. All of us. A grand conspiracy.

Orla: I like this. Feels revolting but... cathartic.

James: I’m in. But where do we go?

Clare: To the common area near the bridge. Sit comfy, bring snacks. Make a scene.

Michelle: Brilliant. Public protest truanting. As if!

Erin: We’ll take signs. “Chelsea’s Cruelty Off Duty”, that sort of thing.

Orla: I’ll make flyers on my phone. With Chelsea’s face and slogans.

James: You’re savage, Orla.

Erin: Don’t worry, we’re not cruel. Just making a point.

Clare: So tomorrow, first bell, not there. Got it?

All together: Got it.

Michelle: Erin—

Erin: Yeah?

Michelle: Promise you’ll stay with us. No backing off.

Erin: Promise.

Orla: God, I can’t wait to see the look on her face.

James: This is going to be epic.

16,"Gerry, Jim, Joe and Colm are in the car. They are wondering why Bill Clinton was brought to Burt. Uncle Colm explains that he is American's thirty-fifth president, whereas JFK was the twenty-eighth.","[Inside Gerry’s old hatchback, afternoon. Gerry is driving. Jim in front passenger seat. Joe and Uncle Colm in the back.]

Gerry: So, I still don’t get it – why’d they bring Bill Clinton to Burt’s funeral?

Jim: Aye, Gerry, sure I thought he was still President or something spectacular like that.

Joe: Clinton’s from over there, is he? America, isn’t it? What business has he got with Burt?

Colm: Right, lads. Settle down. Bill Clinton was the thirty‐fifth President of the United States.

Jim: Thirty‐fifth, you say? Didn’t JFK get shot? He was like number… what was he?

Colm: JFK was the twenty‐eighth. Thirty‐fifth was Clinton—William Jefferson Clinton, served 1993 to 2001.

Gerry: Jesus, Colm, you're like a walking history book. So Clinton’s way after Kennedy.

Joe: I thought Kennedy was like, after World War II, but before Vietnam?

Jim: Exactly, Joe. Kennedy was much earlier. Clinton won later elections. So what’s the link with Burt now?

Colm: Well, that’s the thing – there’s no real link. They brought Clinton ’cause Burt was big on charity, had connections. They wanted someone international.

Gerry: Charity, fair enough. But still, seems a bit over the top.

Jim: Ye think maybe they just wanted the prestige? A big name to show they mean business.

Joe: Or maybe Burt paid for it. That kind of funeral don’t come cheap with ex‐Presidents turning up.

Colm: Could be any of those. But bring it back home – makes us wonder about our own politics, our own leaders.

Gerry: True enough. Though I’ll never understand why Americans number their Presidents the way Colm just did.

Jim: It’s like collecting football cards, but you're voting them in instead of trading them.

Joe: Next thing you know, they’ll be giving numbers to pets. “This is Rufus, he’s the forty-second dog of the house.”

Colm: (laughs) Right, that I’d pay to see. But let's just say, Clinton being thirty-fifth and JFK being twenty-eighth – that’s how the lineage runs. And Burt wanted to honour that kind of legacy."
20,Gerry and Granda Joe are driving back from Roscarna Road. They pass the same 'WELCOME TO BURT' sign that they passed the previous night. They are back in the same place.,"[In Gerry’s car, evening. Gerry driving, Granda Joe in the passenger seat. They pass the “WELCOME TO BURT” sign.]

Gerry: There it is again. Welcome to Burt. You’d think by now I’d know the place like the back of me hand.

Granda Joe: (peering out) That sign looks the same as last night, Gerry. Maybe we’re stuck in a loop.

Gerry: Oh come on, Joe. Don’t start with your conspiracy theories now.

Granda Joe: I’m only saying. The road looked different, the lamp posts new. Or maybe it’s just my eyesight.

Gerry: Probably your eyesight. Or your head. Did you sleep at all?

Granda Joe: Slept like a baby. Woke up every two hours screaming.

Gerry: (sighs) You had the fire alarm in your dreams again.

Granda Joe: I told you, it wasn’t a dream. I could hear bombs.

Gerry: Bombs? This isn’t Belfast, Joe.

Granda Joe: In my mind it is. These roads, these signs — they all bring me back.

Gerry: You’re too old for this, Pops.

Granda Joe: And what about you, Gerry? You think I’m the only one haunted?

Gerry: I’m just glad the girls are asleep. If Erin saw this sign again, she’d have something to say.

Granda Joe: Orla’d probably write a poem. Erin’d want to debate it.

Gerry: That’s exactly it. Erin—always with her arguing, her questions. You never quiet are you, Erin?

Granda Joe: Not like me. I’m quiet now. Quiet is dangerous.

Gerry: (glancing at him) You still planning on going to Roscarna Road tomorrow?

Granda Joe: Aye. Something didn’t sit right with me there.

Gerry: You think there’s more to this place than just memories and walls?

Granda Joe: There’s always more, son. Always more.

Gerry: (pulling over) I’ll stop. You want a cigarette?

Granda Joe: If you like. Let’s sit here a moment. Look at that sign again. Let it sink in.

Gerry: (turns off engine) Welcome to Burt.

Granda Joe: (softly) Welcome home."

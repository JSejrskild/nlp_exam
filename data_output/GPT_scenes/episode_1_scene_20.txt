[In the school corridor. Erin and Orla are waiting outside their English classroom. Erin clutches a small prayer card.]

ERIN: I still can’t believe the Statue of the Child of Prague is here in school. Did you hear Ms. De Brn got it from the Bishop himself?

ORLA: Aye—just passed around the Derry Diocese like a holy hot potato.

ERIN: It’s supposed to bring good luck. Maybe it’ll bless my essays, finally.

ORLA: Or maybe Ms. De Brn will use it as a punishment. “Miss a comma, thou shalt not pass.”

(Ms. De Brn opens the door.)

MS. DE BRN: Good morning, girls. Hope you’re ready for English—today we begin poetry.

ERIN: Morning, Ms. De Brn. Will the Child of Prague help us with rhymes, do you think?

MS. DE BRN: Possibly. But I expect you to work as hard as if you were standing in front of him.

ORLA: Even if we mess up, he might forgive us?

MS. DE BRN: With enough effort, yes. But I’m not a saint.

(They enter classroom; Sister Michael is inside placing the statue on a shelf.)

SISTER MICHAEL: Classes are about to begin. I’d like to remind everyone Sister Patrick will not be returning—her missionary work in Belfast starts next week.

ERIN (whispering to Orla): That’s where all the drama is, right?

ORLA: Belfast... the big leagues of trouble.

MARY: (offstage, calling through window) Erin! Don’t forget your blazer! And who’s taking care of the Child of Prague during Georgina’s lockdown?

GERRY: (following Mary) I saw him—statue’s safe. Sister Michael’s minding him.

ERIN: Thank God. I couldn't live with myself if the Bishop got word that we lost his Baby Jesus.

MS. DE BRN: Now, for today’s poem: explore injustice. Compare your knee-jerk reactions to suffering—Saints, statues, and school alike.

ORLA: (to Erin) This’ll be good. Maybe I’ll write about that time Mammy banned us from the bridge.

ERIN: That, and how Sister Declan died... except almost ninety-eight didn’t stop us freaking out.

MS. DE BRN: Excellent material. You two—pull up chairs. And remember—violence is less helpful than understanding. Even for statuary.

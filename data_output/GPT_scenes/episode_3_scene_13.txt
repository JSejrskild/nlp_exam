[Outside near the lane. A battered white van with ROMANIAN GYPSIES around it, packing belongings. James is helping lift blankets and crates. Michelle runs up panting.]

Michelle: James! Jesus, just get in the van, for God’s sake!

James: I’m not getting in any van. I'm helping these folks move their things, fair play.

Michelle: You heard what Jonjo said—he needs you behind the wheel before the crossroads, or we’ll be stopped.

Jonjo: (calling) You’re dawdlin’, lad! Ain’t got all day!

James: I’m busy! These gypsies asked for help—who am I to turn away?

Michelle: You’re my brother! And you promised me you’d protect us from trouble—not bring more.

James: Helping people ain’t trouble. It’s kindness. Something you’ve forgotten.

Jonjo: (stepping in) Kindness won’t stop the Garda checkpoint, will it? You think they’ll say “thanks for lending a hand”?

Michelle: Exactly! (turns to James) Every minute here’s risk.

James: (firm) I’ll risk it. They lost everything in the fire. And now you ask me to abandon them?

Michelle: They’re strangers, James. What about our safety? What about our future?

James: Our future is built on what we do now—if we abandon people now, we’ll regret it forever.

Jonjo: (losing patience) You’ll let sentry dogs tear apart the back of the van while you argue poetry?

Michelle: Stop talking in riddles, James! Get in that driver’s seat before—

James: No. I won’t. Not until everyone is safe inside. All of them.

Michelle: (exasperated) You’re impossible.

Orla: (walking out from house) What’s all the shouting?

Erin: Sounds like James is making a speech again.

Michelle: Orla, Erin, stay back. This is serious.

Erin: Serious or stupid? One word away between each, sometimes.

Jonjo: Look, Erin, Orla—help me load the last crate or go inside.

Erin: I ain't lifting crates for smugges.

Orla: Who are smugges?

Erin: Gypsies. Haven’t you ever seen a TV?

James: Enough! (“turns to Michelle”) I know you fear things gone wrong. But I can’t leave them waiting.

Michelle: You can’t stay either! We both could get in trouble.

James: Then we will. But you’ll see—history’ll judge us better for staying than for walking away.

Jonjo: Well, judge away, but you better be ready to drive like you mean it when I say go.

Michelle: (to James) When I say go, do it. No more speeches.

James: I'll be ready. (looks at the gypsies smiling at him) Let’s finish this—together.

[Michelle steps back, Jonjo returns to van, Erin and Orla watch. James lifts final crate.]

Jonjo: That’s the last one.

Michelle: Go. Drive.

James: Hold tight.

(The van door slams shut, Jonjo starts the engine, van pulls away slowly, James stands watching with Michelle.)

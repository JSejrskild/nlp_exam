[In Dennis’s front room. Erin, Clare, Michelle, Orla, and James are gathered; Erin holds a half-empty Subbuteo box.]

Erin: Dennis! Where’s the rest of the Subbuteo set you promised for Protestants?

Dennis: I’m sorry—out of stock. They’ve none left in Belfast, Derry—nowhere.

Clare: Out of stock?! You told us you had it yesterday!

Michelle: Yeah. And I’ve been counting on that magic midfield player since yesterday.

James: You promised instalments, too—now I’ve spent my pocket money on nothing but promise.

Orla: Instalments, instalments—they sound just like a loan shark in shiny shoes, but we’ll take it.

Erin: So what do we do? Keep waiting? You’ll buy it, or…?

Dennis: I could find a similar set from a second-hand shop but it won’t be official.

Clare: Official? Dennis, we don’t need fancy. We need Subbuteo. Protestants won’t care if it’s chipped.

Orla: As long as we can pretend it’s new at school.

James: And we still get the players in the right kits, right? No funny colours.

Dennis: Maybe. But it'll cost more. I can give you the instalment plan—half now, half later.

Erin: Fine. I’ll take half now. Michelle?

Michelle: Half now for me too. Clare? You okay with late payment?

Clare: I’ll scrape together what I can. Work at the shop this weekend.

Orla: I can help too—babysit Mrs. McCall’s dog. Any dog-sitting counts as Subbuteo fund.

James: Right. When are we paying you the rest, Dennis?

Dennis: Two weeks. Okay? Two weeks and the rest is due.

Erin: And you get us the boxes then?

Dennis: If I can. If they’re back in stock.

Orla: If not, you find another way. We’ll not be out-played.

Erin: Right. Deal.

(All nod, some reluctantly clutching coins, others sharing hopeful glances.)

[They disperse, Erin lingering, staring at Dennis.]

Erin: Thanks, Dennis. And don’t let us down. I’ve got dreams of scoring on Rory Crawford.

Dennis: I’ll not let you down, Erin. I promise.

(Erin exits; Dennis sighs, glances at the empty space once occupied by the Subbuteo set.)

[At the school gym, decked out with streamers and disco lights. A band plays a slow song. Students dance. The stage is lit. Clare and Mae enter together.]

Clare: (nervously straightening her dress) Mae, I can’t believe we dragged ourselves out for this.

Mae: Sure, but it's prom—it's what you’re supposed to hate and love at the same time.

[They spot Jenny across the room, in a striking red dress, surrounded by admirers.]

Mae: Look at Jenny. Red's definitely her colour.

Clare: She looks like a flame. I feel like a slightly damp match beside her.

Mae: Stop that. You look grand.

[Jenny waves and glides over.]

Jenny: My two favourite silent types—Clare! Mae! You both look gorgeous.

Mae: Thanks, love. Jenny, red's a power move, isn’t it?

Jenny: I thought I’d steal a bit of the spotlight tonight.

[Michelle appears, looking distressed. Two boys hover near a punch bowl.]

Michelle: Hey! Simon! Darren! Stop spreading rumours about me!

Simon: We’re not—come off it, Michelle.

Darren: Yeah, we were just—chatting!

Michelle: Chatting turned into gossip and next thing I’m the villain in your stories!

Simon: I swear we didn’t mean it like that.

Jenny: (to Michelle) Ignore them. Don’t give oxygen to their nonsense.

Clare: It’s prom—drama rolls in with the punch.

Mae: And lands hard.

Michelle: (taking a deep breath) Fine. No more letting them push me around.

Simon: I’m sorry... and I’ll help fix what I said.

Darren: Me too.

Michelle: (nods) Thank you. And you—stop circling me.

Jenny: (smirks) That’s better. Now, how about we dance before someone trips over the cords?

Clare: Oh god, look at the stage. They're starting "Night of our Lives."

Mae: Perfect timing.

[Mae and Clare exchange a look, Jenny offers her hand to Michelle.]

Jenny: C’mon girls. Let’s make a memory.

Michelle: (accepts Jenny’s hand) A memory without Simon and Darren interfering.

[They move toward the dance floor together as the band plays.]

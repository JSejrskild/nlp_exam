[Inside Gerry’s old hatchback, afternoon. Gerry is driving. Jim in front passenger seat. Joe and Uncle Colm in the back.]

Gerry: So, I still don’t get it – why’d they bring Bill Clinton to Burt’s funeral?

Jim: Aye, Gerry, sure I thought he was still President or something spectacular like that.

Joe: Clinton’s from over there, is he? America, isn’t it? What business has he got with Burt?

Colm: Right, lads. Settle down. Bill Clinton was the thirty‐fifth President of the United States.

Jim: Thirty‐fifth, you say? Didn’t JFK get shot? He was like number… what was he?

Colm: JFK was the twenty‐eighth. Thirty‐fifth was Clinton—William Jefferson Clinton, served 1993 to 2001.

Gerry: Jesus, Colm, you're like a walking history book. So Clinton’s way after Kennedy.

Joe: I thought Kennedy was like, after World War II, but before Vietnam?

Jim: Exactly, Joe. Kennedy was much earlier. Clinton won later elections. So what’s the link with Burt now?

Colm: Well, that’s the thing – there’s no real link. They brought Clinton ’cause Burt was big on charity, had connections. They wanted someone international.

Gerry: Charity, fair enough. But still, seems a bit over the top.

Jim: Ye think maybe they just wanted the prestige? A big name to show they mean business.

Joe: Or maybe Burt paid for it. That kind of funeral don’t come cheap with ex‐Presidents turning up.

Colm: Could be any of those. But bring it back home – makes us wonder about our own politics, our own leaders.

Gerry: True enough. Though I’ll never understand why Americans number their Presidents the way Colm just did.

Jim: It’s like collecting football cards, but you're voting them in instead of trading them.

Joe: Next thing you know, they’ll be giving numbers to pets. “This is Rufus, he’s the forty-second dog of the house.”

Colm: (laughs) Right, that I’d pay to see. But let's just say, Clinton being thirty-fifth and JFK being twenty-eighth – that’s how the lineage runs. And Burt wanted to honour that kind of legacy.

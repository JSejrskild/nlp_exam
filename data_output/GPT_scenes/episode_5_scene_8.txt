[In the McKenna living room. Mae is frantically rummaging through her wardrobe. Mammy sits knitting in a chair.]

Mae: Mammy, where is it? The red dress—my prom dress! I know I left it here.

Mammy: Calm yourself, Mae. You were told to hang it up. It's not fair to lose things in the chaos.

Mae: (yelling) I didn’t lose it! Someone took it. Jenny has it. I saw her in it yesterday.

Mammy: Jenny? Your friend Jenny? Why on earth would she—

Mae: Because she told everyone she loved my dress. And then, Mammy… she wore it. At Mark’s party.

Mammy: Aw, Mae. That’s… somethin’. Did you speak to her?

Mae: (glares) Not yet. I was too mad. Thought I’d come home and it’d be here. But it’s gone.

[Door slams. Jenny enters, carrying a bag.]

Jenny: Hiya, Mae! Thought I’d bring the extra snack for drama club.

Mae: (coldly) Oh. Snacks. Nice of you.

Jenny: What’s wrong?

Mammy: Mae thinks you have her red dress.

Jenny: (shocked) Mae, I—no! I haven’t taken it. I borrowed it for the party, Mammy.

Mae: Borrowed! Without asking! That’s not borrowing, it’s theft.

Jenny: I asked your cousin last week! I was told she’d lend it if I really needed it. I thought it was okay.

Mae: You thought? The dress has my name on the label!

Mammy: Girls, girls. Sit down. Let’s hear the full story.

Jenny: Mae, I did wear it at Mark’s. It fitted great. But I meant to bring it back today. I just… forgot.

Mae: Of course you forgot. Now everyone thinks it’s yours.

Jenny: I’ll take it off if you want.

Mae: No. It wouldn’t fit now. And the sequins fell off.

Mammy: Jenny, go get the dress and show Mae what state it’s in. Be honest.

Jenny: (huffs, walks to Mae’s room) I’ll get it.

Mae: (to Mammy) I should’ve guarded it like a saint.

Mammy: You must learn trust, Mae. But boundaries too.

[Jenny returns, dress in hand. Dress is wrinkled.]

Jenny: Here. I’m sorry. See? Not perfect.

Mae: (examining) It’s a mess. But thanks for bringing it back.

Jenny: I’ll pay to fix the sequins. And I won’t wear it again without asking.

Mae: (softens) Fine. And next time, ask me.

Mammy: That’s all we ask. Promise kept.

Jenny: Promise.

Mae: (sighs) Well, I suppose this means finding a new plan for prom shoes.

Jenny: I can help you pick. Something better than yesterday’s sneakers?

Mae: (smiles reluctantly) Yes. Definitely better than that.

Mammy: That’s my girls. Now pass me that knitting—off we go to hunt for glamour.

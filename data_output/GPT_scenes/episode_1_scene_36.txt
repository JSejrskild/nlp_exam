[On a dimly lit Belfast street late at night. Erin and Jenny Joyce are standing outside a house, waiting.]

Jenny Joyce: Do you think she’s okay in there, Erin?

Erin: (frowning) She stank of drink when I left her. I don’t know about okay, Jes.

Jenny Joyce: Maybe she just needed to get away. Ms. De Brn’s place has a fire in the fireplace. Warm.

Erin: Warm’s one thing. But her tears were warm too. Real hot.

Jenny Joyce: (scoffs) You and Clare, you two are cut from the same cloth, Erin. Reckless, stubborn.

Erin: Reckless? Maybe. But I won’t just leave her to sober up alone in someone else’s house.

Jenny Joyce: What if Ms. De Brn kicks us out? She’s strict about visitors this late.

Erin: Better kicked out than worrying ourselves sick. Come on.

[They both approach the front door. Erin lifts her fist to knock.]

Erin: (shouts) Clare! You in there? It’s Erin!

(Silence. A faint giggle comes from inside.)

Jenny Joyce: She’s laughing, Jen. That ain’t a good thing.

Erin: (voice shaking) Clare… open up. Jaysus, you’re scaring me.

(Door creaks. Clare appears in the doorway, dishevelled, eyes red.)

Clare: Erin. Jes. Don’t come in. I’m fine.

Erin: You’re not fine. You’re swaying like a lamppost in wind.

Claire: It’s just the drink talking. I’ll sleep it off.

Jenny Joyce: Then we’ll be right here till you sober up. We’ve got mad notions of responsibility now, Erin.

[Erin places a steadying arm around Clare’s shoulder as Jenny Joyce looks on anxiously.]

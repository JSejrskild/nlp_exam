[In Gerry’s car, evening. Gerry driving, Granda Joe in the passenger seat. They pass the “WELCOME TO BURT” sign.]

Gerry: There it is again. Welcome to Burt. You’d think by now I’d know the place like the back of me hand.

Granda Joe: (peering out) That sign looks the same as last night, Gerry. Maybe we’re stuck in a loop.

Gerry: Oh come on, Joe. Don’t start with your conspiracy theories now.

Granda Joe: I’m only saying. The road looked different, the lamp posts new. Or maybe it’s just my eyesight.

Gerry: Probably your eyesight. Or your head. Did you sleep at all?

Granda Joe: Slept like a baby. Woke up every two hours screaming.

Gerry: (sighs) You had the fire alarm in your dreams again.

Granda Joe: I told you, it wasn’t a dream. I could hear bombs.

Gerry: Bombs? This isn’t Belfast, Joe.

Granda Joe: In my mind it is. These roads, these signs — they all bring me back.

Gerry: You’re too old for this, Pops.

Granda Joe: And what about you, Gerry? You think I’m the only one haunted?

Gerry: I’m just glad the girls are asleep. If Erin saw this sign again, she’d have something to say.

Granda Joe: Orla’d probably write a poem. Erin’d want to debate it.

Gerry: That’s exactly it. Erin—always with her arguing, her questions. You never quiet are you, Erin?

Granda Joe: Not like me. I’m quiet now. Quiet is dangerous.

Gerry: (glancing at him) You still planning on going to Roscarna Road tomorrow?

Granda Joe: Aye. Something didn’t sit right with me there.

Gerry: You think there’s more to this place than just memories and walls?

Granda Joe: There’s always more, son. Always more.

Gerry: (pulling over) I’ll stop. You want a cigarette?

Granda Joe: If you like. Let’s sit here a moment. Look at that sign again. Let it sink in.

Gerry: (turns off engine) Welcome to Burt.

Granda Joe: (softly) Welcome home.

[In the Quinn kitchen. Clare, Michelle, Erin, Orla and James clustered around the table. James tapping angrily on mug; Orla reading something on phone.]

Erin: I’m telling you, she’s gone too far this time. Chelsea thinks she's queen of the school.

Clare: Aye, and we’re the peasants in her court. It’s not fair.

Michelle: She was slaggin’ me in front of everyone yesterday. Said I look like I slept in my uniform.

James: She’s been acting the maggot since the start of term.

Orla: Fine, what are we doing about it? Complaining never worked before.

Erin: We’ll teach her a lesson. A lesson she’ll never forget.

Clare: Are you thinkin’ what I’m thinkin’?

Michelle: Sicknote from Mam? Disappearing to the loo forever?

James: No. Truant.

Orla: You mean… skip school? All of us?

Erin: A protest. We don’t go in. Not one of us. She won’t know what hit her.

James: My Ma’ll kill me.

Clare: She won’t know where I am, anyway. Trust me, I’ve got it sorted.

Michelle: And what about homework? Teachers notice absence.

Erin: We’ll tell ‘em we’re sick. All of us. A grand conspiracy.

Orla: I like this. Feels revolting but... cathartic.

James: I’m in. But where do we go?

Clare: To the common area near the bridge. Sit comfy, bring snacks. Make a scene.

Michelle: Brilliant. Public protest truanting. As if!

Erin: We’ll take signs. “Chelsea’s Cruelty Off Duty”, that sort of thing.

Orla: I’ll make flyers on my phone. With Chelsea’s face and slogans.

James: You’re savage, Orla.

Erin: Don’t worry, we’re not cruel. Just making a point.

Clare: So tomorrow, first bell, not there. Got it?

All together: Got it.

Michelle: Erin—

Erin: Yeah?

Michelle: Promise you’ll stay with us. No backing off.

Erin: Promise.

Orla: God, I can’t wait to see the look on her face.

James: This is going to be epic.

[They lean in, whispering excitedly, plotting.]

Clare: Everyone ready? Tomorrow morning… revolution.

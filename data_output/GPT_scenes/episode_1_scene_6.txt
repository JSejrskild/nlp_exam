[In Jenny’s bedroom. Aisling is rummaging through Jenny’s wardrobe.]

Jenny: What are you doing, Aisling?

Aisling: Trying to find something decent to wear. If we’re going to the shops to pick out a present for the Protestants, I’m not going looking like this.

Jenny: It doesn’t have to be fancy, just respectful. Zara’ll be coming with us.

Aisling: Half-Protestant, yeah? Doesn’t that count?

Jenny: It does. But you know her Mam likes tradition. We’ll need something that says “peace offering,” not “you’re culture’s crap.”

[They head downstairs. Jenny’s Mam, Siobhan, is making tea.]

Siobhan: You off to the shops?

Jenny: We are, Mam. We’re buying a present. For Zara’s Protestant part of the family.

Siobhan: (sips tea) Bridging the divide, are we?

Aisling: Something like that. Jenny’s being very grown up.

Jenny: She’s good friends with Zara. And her horse—Donny—he’d love treats too. Maybe we get something horsey.

Siobhan: Just stay away from anything that’ll start an argument, girls.

[On the street. Jenny and Aisling, walking. Zara meets them, tied to her horse Donny under a hedge.]

Zara: Hey! Ready to shop?

Jenny: Aye. We thought maybe stable stuff for Donny. And something for you and your family.

Aisling: But not too “Protestant,” or they’ll think we’re mocking them.

Zara: My Dad likes oak things. Protestant or not, he loves woodwork.

Jenny: Oak. Good. Solid.

[They reach the market. Wooden crafts stall.]

Aisling: Look at that, oak photo frame.

Jenny: Could put a picture of Zara and Donny in it.

Zara: I have that photo! (Pulls out phone) It’s lovely.

Vendor: Ah, you girls need help deciding?

Jenny: Yes please. Something meaningful.

Vendor: Perhaps this oak bread board—solid, handmade. Symbol of unity, sharing.

Aisling: That could work.

Zara: That’d be perfect for their kitchen.

Jenny: And Donny? What about some carrots?

Vendor: (smirks) Not with me, lass. But there’s a feed stall just down.

Jenny: Right. Let’s get this board, and pick up carrots after.

[They pay, board wrapped. Exit stall.]

Aisling: I think your Dad will like it, Zara.

Zara: And Donny will be nobbled with joy.

Jenny: See? Peace and carrots. Maybe this is what ‘Friends Across the Barricades’ really means.

Aisling: (smiling) Exactly. A gift, a horse, some hope.

[They walk off, Jenny carrying the oak board, Zara leading Donny.]

Zara: Thank you, Jenny. This means a lot.

Jenny: Anytime. Let’s go get Donny’s treats then.

Aisling: And maybe a cuppa after?

Jenny: You read my mind.

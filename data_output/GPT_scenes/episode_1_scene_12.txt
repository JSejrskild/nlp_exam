[In Erin’s bedroom. Erin is putting on a dress. Orla is doing her hair. Clare peeks in.]

Clare: Erin, you really think you should wear *that* to a boy’s party?

Erin: Better than looking like a blowfish, Clare. (frowns at her dress in the mirror)

James: (from the doorway) Confidence, Erin! Be bold like a hawk, not stiff like a blowfish.

Orla: Ew, James. Nobody wants to be a blowfish.

Erin: I’m not sure I want to go, though. A boy’s party sounds… weird.

Michelle: Weird? Erin, boy’s party = opportunity. Opportunity to be *sexy*. (strikes a pose)

Erin: Sexy? Mum, I’m thirteen. If I try to be sexy, I'll look ridiculous.

Michelle: Ridiculous sells, sweetheart. Sometimes ridiculous is the look.

Clare: Look, just be yourself. Unless you’re a blowfish. Then pick a look.

Orla: And if you're going to be sexy, wear red. Red distracts the eye from bad dancing.

James: (rolls his eyes) Are we styling Erin or sending her to battle?

Erin: I just don’t want to regret it later. What if I spill something everywhere?

Michelle: Spill? Then you’ll clean it up, or someone else will.

Jon: (knocks and enters) Hey, girls. You're all ready?

Erin: I think so. Or I’m somewhere between sexy and sensible.

Jon: That’s perfect. No one notices sensible anyway, Erin. Go with the sexy.

James: See? Jon gets it. Confidence, eye contact, smile. Not blowfish.

Erin: (sighs) Fine. Eye contact. Smile. And maybe red lips.

Orla: Don’t let any boys see your diary tonight either. That’s reserved for your enemies.

Clare: Enemy? Who needs enemies when you’ve got siblings?

James: Erin, promise me one thing—you’ll dance even if it feels silly.

Erin: Promise. (takes a deep breath, fixes her dress) Let’s go make a memory, not a mannequin.

Michelle: That’s my girl. Now—smart phone... red lips... strut out that door!

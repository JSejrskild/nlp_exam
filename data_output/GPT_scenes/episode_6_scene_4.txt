[INT. NOLAN KITCHEN – MORNING]

Erin: Mammy, the whole city’s buzzing—they’re closing schools tomorrow. The President of the United States is coming to Derry.

Mary: What? The President? Here?

Orla: Sure, Erin, who else could they mean? Obama? Trump? Some chap who sells burgers?

Erin: No, Orla—President of the USA. He’ll be visiting. Everything’s shut down.

Gerry: Public holiday, they’re saying. Every school. Mary, have you heard?

Mary: First I hear of it. And just when I found a decent bit of peace!

Granda Joe: And now they’ll crowd the streets, she’ll catch me without a hat—face sunburnt.

Sarah: Can’t be doing with that nonsense. And blocking off the roads and all that.

[INT. SISTER MICHAEL’S OFFICE – LATE MORNING]

Sister Michael: Entrance.

Mary: Morning, Sister Michael. We thought we’d see you about this new holiday business.

Sister Michael: Yes, well. The President coming is... monumental. But I’ve concerns.

Erin: What kind of concerns? Is the Pope visiting after him?

Sister Michael: Exactly my fear, Erin. Give the Pope ideas—next thing you know, rosaries everywhere, extra holy days, masses nonstop.

Granda Joe: That’d upset the balance.

Sarah: Mammy’s already frightened her garden shed will get converted into a chapel.

Mary: Sister Michael, sure we like our faith and all, but I don’t need the church running every minute of the clock.

Sister Michael: It’s about precedent. If we start closing schools for heads of state—

Erin: Mammy, you’ll get a lie in tomorrow!

Mary: Don’t you tempt me.

Orla: (licking spoon) Is there cake for this holiday? You know I celebrate with cake.

[They all look at Sister Michael.]

Sister Michael: I’ll speak to the bishop. Try to keep things under control. But yes—expect grand gestures.

Erin: Grand gestures? Mammy, gran, would you rather see the Pope or the President first?

Mary: Don’t be ridiculous, Erin. Both give me palpitations.

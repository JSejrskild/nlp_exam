[At the family home. A dim-lit front room. A coffin sits centre-stage. Sarah, Mary, Joe, Gerry, Colm and Eamonn gathered. Tea, biscuits, hushed voices.]

Colm: She’s gone now, sure. Your mother now at peace, son.

Eamonn: Aye. At peace. That’s what I keep telling meself.

Mary: You look pale, Eamonn. You want a cup of tea, sweetheart?

Eamonn: No thanks, Ma. I’m grand.

Sarah: Your mother always said there was no such thing as a curse.

Joe: Curse? What curse?

Colm: Aye, there's always someone around saying ’twas the house, or the land, or bad blood.

Eamonn: I don’t believe in that nonsense. My mother was good to everyone.

Mary: It’s just the neighbours whispering. People liking to explain things with doom and gloom.

Gerry: You know your mother’s funeral was delayed because of that storm last week? Some said it was a sign.

Eamonn: A sign of what? She had asthma. Storm made it hard for the ambulance. Not curses.

Sarah: Still. I know how folk talk.

Joe: You remember how Mrs. Donnelly swore she saw lights in the graveyard?

Colm: As if the dead are up late hosting discos.

Mary: Oh, Colm. Be respectful.

Eamonn: I want no superstition. I want no curse.

Sarah: That’s your right. But grief makes folk reach for stories.

Joe: True. I seen it myself. After Da died, everyone thought his tool shed was haunted.

Gerry: Haunted sheds, dancing ghouls.

Eamonn: All I want is to lay her to rest without the chatter.

Mary: We’ll do that, love. Your Ma deserves that much.

Colm: We’ll have the wake, the funeral, the tea afterwards—no curses, no ghosts.

Sarah: Just memories, laughter, tears. The way she’d have wanted.

Joe: Amen to that.

Eamonn: Thank you all. Thank you for believing she’s gone, but not because of some curse.

Mary: No curse. Just love.

[They all stand in silence, looking at the coffin. A clock ticks.]

Sarah: She watches over you, Eamonn. That’s no curse—just love.

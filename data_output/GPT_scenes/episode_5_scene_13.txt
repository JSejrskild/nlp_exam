[In the school hall. A 1950s-style dance is underway. Orla in a poodle skirt, Joe in a leather jacket. They’re performing some slick swing moves as a small crowd watches.]

Line 1

Orla: (twirling Joe) Bet you didn’t think I had this in me, Granda?

Line 2

Joe: Don’t matter where you learnt it, lass — you’re nailing it!

Line 3

[They spin under Joe’s arm. Suddenly Clare enters, flanked by two boys — Tommy and Sean, both dressed for the dance.]

Line 4

Clare: (frowning) Oh, here we go…

Line 5

Tommy: Clare, you’re glowing tonight. Who taught you to two-step like that?

Line 6

Sean: (interrupting) Don’t mind him, Clare — I imagine it’s Mae’s influence?

Line 7

Clare: Mae? What has Mae got to do with—?

Line 8

Sean: Kris has been hanging about with her from Donegal, singing all sorts of romantic nonsense.

Line 9

Tommy: I thought you were exclusively seeing me, Clare.

Line 10

Sean: Not exclusive, apparently.

Line 11

Kris: (approaching with Mae, hand in hand) Are we interrupting something?

Line 12

Mae: Hi Clare. I’ve heard a lot about you.

Line 13

Clare: Kris— Mae! Didn’t expect to see ya here.

Line 14

Tommy: So that’s it, then? Kris is dancing with a Donegal girl now?

Line 15

Sean: Makes a change from Clare, I suppose.

Line 16

Mae: Kris told me nothing is settled — isn’t that right?

Line 17

Kris: I told you. I like you, Mae. But I also care about Clare. I didn’t mean to upset anyone.

Line 18

Clare: (hurt) Upset? You told Mae we were just friends. To me, it felt different.

Line 19

Sean: (scoffs) Feelings are messy, aren’t they?

Line 20

Orla: (calling out to Joe mid dance) Joe, hold on a minute—look over there!

Line 21

Joe: (pauses partner) What is it now?

Line 22

Orla: That’s Clare. She looks like she’s about to burst.

Line 23

Mae: I’m sorry, Clare. I didn’t mean to come between you two.

Line 24

Kris: (taking Clare’s hand) Clare, I never lied about what I felt. I was scared, that’s all.

Line 25

Clare: (softening) Maybe… maybe we talk after the dance?

Line 26

[Outside the circle, Orla and Joe resume dancing. Clare watches, Mae beside her, Kris just behind. Sean and Tommy slink away, music swells.]

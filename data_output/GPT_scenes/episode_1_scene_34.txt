[Evening. De Brún’s living room. Soft lamplight. Erin, James, Michelle, Orla, and Clare sit on a worn couch and armchairs. De Brún enters with tea tray.]

De Brún: (smiling) Here we are. Hot tea and biscuits. Nothing too fancy—just us.

Erin: (accepting cup) Thanks, Ms. De Brún. This is lovely.

Clare: This house feels so warm. Like it’s breathing.

Michelle: I like your curtains, Ms. De Brún. They’re purple—but not too scary purple.

James: (peeking at photos on mantelpiece) Who’s that man in the sailing boat?

De Brún: That’s my father. He loved boats. Used to take me out every summer.

Orla: You’re lucky. My grandma once took me on a paddleboat. I almost drowned.

Erin: Orla! You’re always dramatic.

Orla: A little drama is good. It keeps the heart beating.

De Brún: (laughs) Would anyone like more tea? Or perhaps some hot chocolate?

Michelle: Hot chocolate, please! With marshmallows if you have them.

James: Yes! Marshmallows are essential to any evening.

Clare: I’ll have tea, thank you.

Erin: Hot chocolate for me too.

[De Brún pours drinks, handing them out.]

De Brún: So, tell me honestly—what do you like about me so far?

Erin: (considering) You’re... different. You listen.

Michelle: And you don’t always punish us. You talk.

James: You laugh. And sometimes you let us choose the music.

Orla: You don’t judge. Even when we fight, you don’t take sides. That’s nice.

De Brún: (quietly) Thank you. That means more than you know.

Clare: It’s weird—just two days. Feels like I’ve always known you.

Erin: Me too. I was braced for lectures, uniforms, rules. Instead, you let us be.

[Door creaks. De Brún pauses.]

De Brún: Shall I put on some music?

Erin: Yes! Something rock or Gaelic or—

Michelle: Anything but funeral dirge.

Orla: (grinning) Or opera. Let opera surprise us!

[De Brún presses play; gentle guitar strumming begins. The room softens.]

De Brún: There, just some acoustic folk. Thought it might suit the moment.

James: It suits. Feels… peaceful.

Erin: (raising her mug) To new beginnings. And to you, Ms. De Brún.

Everyone: To Ms. De Brún.

[They clink mugs. Music plays. Moments of comfortable silence.]

Clare: Will we do this again? Night at yours?

De Brún: Of course, Clare. My door’s always open.

Erin: (smiling) Then tonight, I think I just found a home away from home.

De Brún: And I’m honored to share it with all of you.

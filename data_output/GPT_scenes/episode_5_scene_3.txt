[In the Quinn living room. Clare is sitting on the sofa, James reading a comic. Erin enters, overhearing them.]

Erin: What are you two sulking about?

Clare: Nothing, Erin, really.

James: Clare wanted to ask me something—but, well, it’s a bit awkward.

Erin: Is this about prom?

Clare: Yes.

James: The prom is the same night as Doctor Who night.

Erin: Seriously? That’s tragic.

Clare: I was going to ask you to go with me, James.

James: I know. I just… I’m a lesbian, Clare. Prom feels like a different kind of asking out.

Clare: Right. I didn’t think straight about that. I just thought…

James: I know, Clare. And I’m flattered—it’s sweet.

Erin: So what’re you going to do?

James: I won’t go to prom. I’ll stay home and watch Doctor Who.

Clare: I get that. I’m sorry if I made this complicated.

Mary (off-stage, calling): Erin! Are you in there? Dinner’s ready!

Erin: (loud whisper) I vote Doctor Who night.

Clare: Me too—just keep the time open, James.

[They share a small smile as Erin exits to call Mary, Clare and James sit quietly, slightly awkward but closer.]

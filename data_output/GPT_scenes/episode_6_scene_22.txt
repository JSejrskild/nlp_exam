[Outdoor stage, a political rally. A MAN in a sharp suit stands at a podium flanked by flags. The crowd includes Michelle, Erin, Clare, James, and Bill Clinton. Erin and James are craning their necks; Clare looks excited.]

Man: Ladies and gentlemen, it is my greatest honour to introduce—

(A small drumroll)

—the President of the United States of America!

Erin: (elbows James) Is that really him, James? Look at that hair.

James: I’d know those ears anywhere.

Clare: (to Michelle) I can’t believe we got tickets!

Michelle: (smiling nervously) Aye, but you know how these things go—everyone screaming and fainting.

Bill Clinton: (stepping forward from the crowd, waving) Thank you! Thank you all!

Erin: (gasps) He’s here! Mr. President!

Bill Clinton: (into microphone) Thank you for welcoming me today.

I’ve heard tales of Belfast’s spirit, its strength—and its heart.

Clare: Heart. I like hearing that.

Erin: And what about the bombs? What about the bridges?

Michelle: Erin—shimmy down. You’re embarrassing us.

James: She has a point though.

Bill Clinton: We must build more than roads; we build trust.

We must lift fear off shoulders and let young voices be heard.

Man: (off-camera) Mr. President, your schedule—

Bill Clinton: I insist this audience stays as long as needs be.

Change doesn’t come with silence.

Erin: (cheering) Hear, hear!

Clare: (joins in) Aye! Let them talk!

Michelle: (claps) Well said, sir.

James: Think Mam would believe this if I told her I shook hands with the President?

Bill Clinton: (points toward Erin and James) And you—young people—are the heartbeat of peace.

Never let anyone tell you you have no power.

Erin: I believe that.

Clare: Me too.

[As applause rises, Erin and Clare exchange triumphant smiles. James looks awed. Michelle wipes a tear.]

[In the Quinn kitchen. Early morning light. Mary is sitting at the kitchen table, staring into a cup of tea. Erin is doing the dishes. Orla is hovering nearby with a feather duster.]<br>
Mary: (quietly) I still can’t believe she’s gone.<br>
Erin: (rinsing a plate) Aye, Mammy. It’s terrible. But you—none of this was your fault.<br>
Orla: I’m sorry, Auntie Mary. She was lovely.<br>
Mary: Lovely, yes. But if I’d phoned her last week instead of putting off… if I’d gone to see her…<br>
Erin: (putting down dish) Mammy—there’s nothing you could’ve done.<br>
Orla: Absolutely nothing.<br>
Mary: (voice trembling) You don’t know that. I keep thinking, what if I’d… if I’d been kinder.<br>
Erin: Kindness wouldn’t have changed what was coming.<br>
Orla: Sometimes bad things just happen.<br>
Mary: But I didn’t visit, Erin. I sent a card, sure. A sodding card.<br>
Erin: A card with love in it. That counts.<br>
Orla: Mum always loved your voice when you called.<br>
Mary: (wipes her eyes) I suppose… I suppose she did.<br>
Erin: You’re going to the wake, Mammy?<br>
Mary: Yes. I need to. I need to see her coffin. Say goodbye properly.<br>
Orla: We’ll help you, Auntie Mary.<br>
Erin: I’ll do the dishes and I’ll dust the stairs after. You rest a while.<br>
Mary: Erin, you don’t have to—<br>
Erin: I want to. It’ll give my mind something to do besides wondering.<br>
Orla: I’ll dry. And I’ll polish the windows if you like.<br>
Mary: Thank you, girls. I don’t deserve such kindness.<br>
Erin: Yes you do, Mammy. More than you know.<br>
Kitchen doorbell rings.<br>
Mary: (startled) Who’s that at this hour?<br>
Erin: I’ll get it. (wipes hands, opens door) Oh—it's Mrs. Fleming from across the road.<br>
Mrs. Fleming: I heard the news, Mary. I came by to offer my condolences.<br>
Mary: That’s very kind. Come in, Mrs. Fleming. I’d appreciate the company.<br>
Erin: (aside, to Orla) See, Mammy’s made it through to this morning. Small victories.<br>

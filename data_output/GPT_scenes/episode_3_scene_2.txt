[In the Quinn kitchen. Erin, Orla, Michelle, Clare and James are stuffing stuff into bags.]

Erin: Right, girls, this is it — This and That concert tonight. I can’t believe we got tickets.

Orla: I’ve packed my good camera. If I don’t get at least one epic crowd shot, I’m returning to poverty.

Clare: And I’ve got enough eyeliner to black out an entire stadium.

James: You do realise I can’t see when you do that, right? I’ll probably trip over wires or something.

Michelle: Oh James, you’ll survive. As long as you don’t end up dragged onstage.

Erin: Just imagine all the banter. All the songs. ALL of it.

Mary: (from offstage) Ladies! What’s the state of this?

[Mary enters, holding her phone.]

Mary: I’ve to ring Gerry and Granda Joe. They need to agree you can go.

Erin: Mammy, you don’t think they’ll say no, do you?

Orla: I promise, we’ll be safe. Clare’s uncle is picking us up from the venue.

Clare: Yes, he has a car! Not one of yours that might fall apart halfway.

James: I’ll be with you the whole time. Pack of us, us five.

Mary: Fine, but I need to ‘sell’ it. They’ll think it’s all noise and bad influence.

Michelle: It’s This and That! It’s cultural enrichment! Music! Good vibrations!

Erin: If you say “good vibrations”, I’ll puke.

[Mary dials phone.]

Mary: Gerry? Hi love. I have a proposition.

Gerry: (voice via phone) What is it this time?

Mary: The girls want to go to a concert tonight — This and That band. Good bunch, Mary says.

Gerry: A concert? At this hour?

Mary: Yes love, I know. But Clare’s uncle will pick them up. James, too. I’ll be there early.

Gerry: (voice) What about Curfew? You’ll bring them home safe?

Mary: Of course. No risks with … noise and crowd.

[Erin exchanges relieved look with Orla, Michelle smiles.]

Gerry: (voice) Right. But tickets cost?

Mary: Already done.

Gerry: (voice) Then sure. Have fun — but I want updates every half hour.

Mary: You’ll get’em.

[Sister Michael’s old radio plays in background.]

Mary: Erin, be in by midnight.

Erin: Midnight. We’ll fly in then. Promise.

Orla: I’ll text if the concert turns into an apocalypse.

James: See you later Mam! Bye Clare! Let’s go tick off some concrete dancing.

[They all grab bags, head to door.]

Clare: Best night ever, you wretched lot.

Michelle: High on music and freedom.

Mary: (smiling) You lot better behave. And bring me back stories, not mess.

Erin: Always, Mam.

[They rush out the door, laughing. Mary watches them go, concerned but proud.]

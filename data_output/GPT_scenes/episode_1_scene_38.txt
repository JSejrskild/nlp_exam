[Scene: The Quinn kitchen. Orla is at the table doing homework. Erin bursts in, backpack slung over shoulder. Mary is brewing tea. Granda Joe is sitting reading the paper.]

Erin: Mammy! Did you hear? Sister Michael’s taking our class now – for the rest of the term!

Mary: (startled) What? Is that proper?

Orla: (without looking up) Oh great. More nuns. As if one wasn’t enough.

Erin: I thought Ms. De Brn was harsh but—Sister Michael sings hymns in detention now. Hymns!

Granda Joe: Aye, but she might be better than that old git Ms. De Brn, God rest her soul.

Mary: Let’s not speak ill of the gone, Gerald.

[Cut to: Classroom. Sister Michael at the front, chalk in hand. Students murmur. Erin and Clare sit together.]

Sister Michael: Settle down, children. As you know, I will be teaching you for the rest of the term.

Clare: (whispering to Erin) Any idea where Ms. De Brn’s gone?

Erin: Dunno. Probably politics. Or hiding from us lot.

Sister Michael: Today’s lesson is poetry. I want each of you to write about something you care deeply about.

Orla: (in thought) Conflict? Identity? The bridge? Bombs?

Erin: (leans over) Don’t you dare write about bombs again. I’ve done enough trauma.

Sister Michael: Erin, your voice is important. If you want to write about bombs, write about your truth.

[Back in kitchen: Mary wiping a teacup. Gerry enters, looking dishevelled.]

Gerry: What chaos in there? I swear the school sounded like a cathedral full of banshees.

Mary: That’s Sister Michael for you. She’s moved mountains in that class already.

Granda Joe: (smirks) Mountains, or hymns. Same thing to my ears.

Gerry: Sure, at least there’s no Ms. De Brn lurking behind every desk, breathing down their necks.

Mary: Let’s hope this Sister Michael doesn’t go all Ms. De Brn on them.

[Back in classroom.]

Erin: (writing) …“In the silence between bombs I hear hope…” No, too lofty.

Sister Michael: Beautiful, Erin. Don’t censor your heart.

Orla: (quietly) Maybe this term won’t be such a disaster after all.

[Erin glances at Orla, slightly moved.]

Erin: (softly) Maybe not.

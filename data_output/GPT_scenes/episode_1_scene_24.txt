[In Erin’s bedroom. Erin sits at her desk, writing in a notebook. Michelle knocks and enters.]

Michelle: What’re you writing, Erin?

Erin: It’s a love story... for someone special.

[James slips in behind Michelle.]

James: Ah, romance! Are you going to read it out loud?

Erin: Not yet. I just used a word and they’re asking me what it means.

Michelle: Which word? Is it one of those posh words like “beguile” or something?

Erin: No—it’s “bide.” I wrote: “He will bide with her until dawn.”

Michelle: Bide...? What does that even mean? Stay? Wait?

Erin: Exactly, sort of. “Bide” means to stay somewhere or remain somewhere for a time… to wait.

James: So like when Dad says he’ll bide till the craic’s over before going home?

Erin: Yes, James, exactly like that—but in a romantic way, not your da’s pub habits.

[Mary sticks her head in the door.]

Michelle: Mam, can you help? What does “bide” mean?

Mary: “Bide” is like when you wait for something good—you don’t rush it. You stay patient, you hope.

Erin: Thank you, Mam. Finally someone gets it.

James: So in your story, the lad bides with the lass because he’s waiting for love, not because he’s stuck?

Erin: Precisely! Get your brains in gear, James.

Michelle: Right, now I understand. Go on, read more!

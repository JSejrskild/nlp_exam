[Outside Sister Michael’s office. The group is gathered near a window, watching a suitcase on the pavement. A soldier speaks over a radio. Erin, Michelle, James, Clare, Orla, Roger, Sister Michael stand tense.]

1 Soldier on radio (crackling): “Examining suspect device now. Bomb diffusers… approaching the suitcase.”

2 Erin (whispering): “A suitcase? What sort of monster leaves a suitcase in front of a school?”

3 Michelle: “That’s her vodka. She said she was delivering it. Why a bomb?”

4 James (wide-eyed): “I thought they said it was juice. I hate juice.”

5 Clare: “This is ridiculous. Someone’s playing games. Like that time Dad lost his trousers to the birds.”

6 Orla: “This is serious, Clare. Could go off at any moment.”

7 Roger: “They’re trained. The Army diffusers know what they’re doing.”

8 Sister Michael: “Keep back, everyone. Follow the barricade. Step away from the windows.”

9 Soldier on radio: “Device is confirmed. TNT liner detected. We’re safe-stroking it.”

10 Erin: “What does that even mean, safe-stroking?”

11 Michelle: “It means they’re trying to disarm it, Erin.”

12 James: “Maybe it’s like a video game. Hit the right button, it stops.”

13 Clare: “If this explodes I’ll never tell Mam I cut class again.”

14 Orla: “Not helping. You’re making it worse.”

15 Roger: “Lower voice, please. Sister Michael needs calm.”

16 Sister Michael: “Children, prayer is allowed now.”

17 Erin: “You want us to pray?”

18 Sister Michael: “If it brings peace to your hearts, yes.”

19 Soldier on radio: “Diffusers are in position. Final cuts being made…”

20 Michelle: “I’m scared.”

21 James: “Me too. I thought we left this behind.”

22 Clare: “Bombs and bridges and uniform mansions—”

23 Orla: “Clare!”

24 Soldier on radio: “Device disarmed. Vacuum to contain residue. No explosion.”

25 Erin (exhales): “Thank God. I thought I was going to — I dunno.”

26 Sister Michael: “Let this be a lesson: life’s full of fear, but courage comes when you least expect it.”

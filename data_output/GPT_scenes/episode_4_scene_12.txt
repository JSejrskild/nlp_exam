[Scene: A dimly lit upstairs room. A covered body lies on a bed. On a small table beside it rest a pair of Mammy’s earrings, glittering. Mary and Sarah stand looking at them, tense.]

Mary: (softly) God, Sarah… those earrings—are they really hers?

Sarah: (eyes wide) Mammy’s, by the holy water. I recognised the clasp. Didn’t wear them since she got those at Feeney’s fair.

Mary: (swaying) But… what are they doing here, at this… scene? I mean… I shouldn’t be saying this— but it looks bad.

Sarah: Bad? It’s awful, Mary. If anyone sees those earrings—people’ll talk. This is not just grief now, it’s trouble.

Mary: (pacing) We need to put them somewhere safe. Bury them with her? No, that’ll raise questions.

Sarah: Hide them! Lock 'em in your jewellery box, or under the floorboards. Anywhere!

Mary: (hesitates) I'd hate to lose them. She’d kill me if she thought I misplaced them. After everything.

Sarah: Mammy’s sense of ‘losing’—you wouldn’t live through it. She’d have the heavens and earth turned inside out.

Mary: (stops pacing) Maybe… maybe we leave them with Sister Michael? She has no reason to lie about things.

Sarah: And what if she does? Then those earrings—Mammy’s beloved earrings—end up in some official report.

Mary: (kneels, picks up earrings) I can’t— I can’t leave them here, with this… this body.

Sarah: Don’t touch them too much, they’ll tarnish. Mammy loved them shining.

Mary: (places earrings back on table) Right. We’ll come back for them. Once no one's here. Once it’s safe.

Sarah: Safe? In this house? With the rumours flying? With Granda Joe talking to the neighbours?

Mary: (firmly) It’s the only chance we’ve got. Trust me, Sarah. I’ll look after them. Them earrings are Mammy’s pride.

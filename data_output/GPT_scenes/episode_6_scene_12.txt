[In the Quinn living room. Mary is ironing Erin’s uniform. Orla is reading a parish bulletin.]

Mary: Erin, you’d best hurry—Mass starts in fifteen. Have you seen Bill?

Erin: Bill? He’s been gone all morning. I reckon he’s headed to chapel already.

Orla: (looking up) I heard something on the radio. The Clintons might be in Burt.

Mary: Saints preserve us. The Clintons in Burt is bad enough—what are they after now?

(Bill enters, looking bewildered. A taxi driver’s cap in hand.)

Erin: Where’ve you been? We thought you’d left for Mass.

Bill: I was picked up—Taxi from Burt. Dispatcher said they needed me at chapel.

Mary: What do you mean “they needed you”? For what part of the service?

Bill: I’m supposed to read a passage. Some request from the parish—they said they sent for someone dependable.

Orla: (sniffs) Dependable? More like someone handy to hang onto when the Clintons roll in.

Mary: Well, if the Clintons are coming, we’ll need to be on our best behaviour.

Bill: The dispatcher seemed nervous. Kept mentioning “feeling the air stiff” in Burt.

Erin: Air stiff? Sounds like trouble brewing—politics or otherwise.

Mary: Don’t you go mixing politics with the holy, Erin. Mass isn’t the place.

Orla: Yet they drag us into it all the same—crossfire comes in many garments.

Bill: Whatever they want, I’ll read the passage as asked. God alone knows my heart’s in the right place.

(They exit together toward the chapel. Mary murmurs nervously.)

Mary: May it be good, not scandalous.

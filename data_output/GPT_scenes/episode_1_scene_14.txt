[In the Quinn living room. Clare sits silent on the couch, looking down. James stands nearby in bright pink waterproof trousers, grinning. Erin and Michelle whisper to each other.]

Erin: (whispering, to Michelle) Do you think James knows how much he looks like a… a flaming flamingo?

Michelle: (stifling laughter) I’m not sure. He seems proud of it.

James: (joining in) Come on! These trousers are waterproof. I could stomp through a flood and still keep my dignity.

Erin: Dignity? In pink that loud? I’d hear you from the moon, lad.

Mary: (offstage, calling) Michelle! Erin! Why are you two sneaking around like you're planning a bank heist?

Michelle: (boldly) Mammy, we want to swap Harry.

Mary: Swap Harry? What are you on about?

Erin: Harry from Friends Across the Barricades. You know, Michelle’s crush.

Michelle: We figured if Erin gets Harry, I get... well, someone else.

Mary: (exasperated) You can’t just swap people like you swap sandwiches!

James: (poking in) What about me? Am I part of this trade?

Erin: (ignoring him) Clare, you’re not talking. You’re not even blinking. What’s wrong?

[Clare lifts her head slowly. She opens mouth to speak.]

Erin: Speak, Clare. We can’t make plans in the dark.

Clare: (softly) I…I heard everything last night.

[Silence. Erin and Michelle exchange a look.]

Michelle: (concerned) About Harry?

Clare: About you all… about everything.

[In the pause, James stands firm, pink trousers glinting under lights. Erin looks torn; Michelle hopes.]

Erin: Then we need to talk. All of us together. This swapping nonsense stops unless everyone's okay.

Mary: (entering room) Finally, some sense returning.

[Scene ends.]

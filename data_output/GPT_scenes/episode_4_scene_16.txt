[At Mary and Gerry’s kitchen table. A teapot, cups and a plate of warm scones sit in the middle. Erin, Orla, Gerry, Mary, Sarah and Granda Joe are gathered around, softly solemn from the funeral.]

Granda Joe: Well, I thought we could all use a bit of comfort. Tea hot, scones warm.

Mary: Thank you, Joe. You’re always good at this sort of thing.

Sarah: (breaking a scone apart) Grand, this is lovely. Moist inside — just how I like them.

Erin: (takes a scone, buttering it) It’s nice not feeling completely hollow inside.

Orla: (nibbling) Are these the ones you made this morning, Mammy?

Mary: Aye, before I went to gather everyone.

Gerry: (pouring tea) There’s nothing like tea to settle the nerves.

Granda Joe: (sipping) To dear Sister Declan. May she rest easy now.

Erin: (quietly) Rest easy. I still can’t believe she’s gone.

Sarah: She was ninety-eight, Erin. Lived a long life.

Erin: That doesn’t make it easier, Aunt Sarah. Seeing the body, the hush.

Orla: (softly) I kept thinking I’d wake up and it’d all be a bad dream.

Mary: It’s okay to feel lost, love. We all are.

Gerry: We’ll get through this — together.

Granda Joe: Exactly. Solid as a rock.

Erin: (bites scone) It’s just — the world feels sharper now.

Sarah: Sharper how?

Erin: Like every argument will cut you, every laugh reminds you someone’s gone.

Orla: (murmurs) I don’t like that feeling.

Granda Joe: Time will dull it, girls. But memories... they’ll grow stronger.

Mary: And we remember her good parts. Her stories, her singing, her stubbornness.

Erin: (crunches) I suppose even stubborn nuns teach you something.

Sarah: (raises cup) To Sister Declan — stubborn, kind, unforgettable.

All: To Sister Declan.

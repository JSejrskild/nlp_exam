[Interior of the church hall. Dim lighting. A wake is in progress. Black-and-white photos of the deceased on tables. People seated, murmuring. Sister Michael stands by the coffin, reverently. Bridie enters with Gerry. Father Thomas is leaning against the wall, clutching a half-empty bottle of Jack Daniels.]

Sister Michael: (quietly) Thank you all for coming. May she rest in peace.

Bridie: (muttering to Gerry) I suppose you could’ve made more effort with your suit.

Gerry: It’s your mother, Bridie. Think this is a fashion parade?

Father Thomas: (slurring) Fashion’s dead, Mary. We’re all dead. Might as well drink while we’re still warm.

Sister Michael: (to Father Thomas) Thomas, perhaps you’d like some water?

Father Thomas: Water? (laughs) Weren’t water baptised enough? No, I want Jack.

Gerry: (hisses) For heaven’s sake Thomas, not here.

Bridie: (smiling falsely) Oh let him be, Gerry. He’s pining for a bit of comfort.

Sister Michael: (firmly) Everyone please, a little respect. It’s her wake.

Father Thomas: Respect? I had respect once. Then I found out what it costs.

Bridie: You’d complain if you lost your shadow, Thomas. Brought no cheer to this wake.

Gerry: Bridie, that’s enough.

Sister Michael: Truly, let’s remember the good: her kindness to the orphans, how she—

Bridie: (interrupting) Kindness? She let your sister starve, did she? Don’t raise sainthood just yet.

Gerry: Bridie! That’s—don’t bring up old rubbish here.

Father Thomas: (raises bottle) To old rubbish! To saints and sinners!

Sister Michael: (stern) Thomas, put that down. Now.

Father Thomas: (swallows) You never were one for fun, Sister.

Bridie: Actually, I think she’d have liked that. A drink, a laugh.

Sister Michael: This is not laughter, it’s grief.

Gerry: (softly to Sister Michael) Sorry. She’s had a hard life too.

Sister Michael: We all have, Gerry. But bitterness helps no one.

Father Thomas: (eyes watering) I loved her. Even when she was cruel.

Bridie: Loved her now? You were too busy drinking then to see anything.

Father Thomas: (shakes head) I’m no better than I was. But I’m here.

Sister Michael: You are here. That’s something.

Gerry: Maybe tonight we lay complaints aside—just for her.

Bridie: (quietly) Alright. I’ll try.

Sister Michael: Thank you. Let us pray. (Everyone bows head.)

[Inside “Fanciful Frocks” dress shop. Racks of clothes everywhere. Erin, Clare, Michelle, James, Orla, and Mae are browsing.]

Erin: (holding up a pink dress) Look at this one! Mam, this dress is absolutely mine. It screams ME.

Mae: It’s very… pink. Like candy floss pink. Are you sure?

Clare: It's cute on you, Erin. But maybe a bit too candy-flossy?

James: Pink’s good. Shows you mean business—or bubblegum. Depends.

Michelle: Erin, you’ll turn heads in that. I like it.

Orla: (holding two hangers) What about this purple-and-orange jumpsuit versus the blue one here? I can’t pick.

Erin: Go with what makes you feel like Orla, not like a rainbow vomited on you.

Orla: Hey! Rainbow vomit is very in this season… maybe.

Mae: The blue one is classy. The jumpsuit is loud. You’re loud already.

Clare: True. But loud can be lovely. Depends on how you carry it.

Michelle: (to Orla) Try them both on, see which feels better.

James: And whichever gets fewer comments from aunties at Mass, that’s the one.

Orla: (smiling) Okay, Blue first. Then the jumpsuit. I need them both anyway.

Erin: (twirls in pink dress) See? Pink is perfection.

Mae: Erin, slow down or you'll spin yourself dizzy.

Clare: Let’s guess how many people you’ll make jealous in that dress.

Michelle: I vote seven. Seven jealous people.

James: Minimum. At least half of the school.

Orla: (coming out in blue dress) What about this?

Erin: Oh, Orla, you look stunning. The blue suits you more than the rainbow wake-up call.

Michelle: Yes! That one’s a winner.

Orla: (grins) Dress one blue it is. But maybe I’m coming back for the jumpsuit. Just in case.

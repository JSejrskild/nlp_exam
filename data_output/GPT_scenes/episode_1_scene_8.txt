[Outside school gates. Sister Michael, Jenny, Aisling and Michelle are stepping off a Catholic school bus.]

Michelle: Did you see that one with the bright hair?

Aisling: Shh! You’ll get Sister Michael in trouble.

Jenny: Relax, it’s just a scratch of colour. Makes life interesting.

Sister Michael: Girls, straighten your uniforms. We walk in dignity even when chaos looms.

[The Protestant bus pulls up. Headmistress and Protestant boys disembark in a single file.]

Protestant Boy 1: Morning, Sister.

Protestant Boy 2: Good day, ma’am.

Headmistress: We trust you had a safe journey.

Sister Michael: Indeed. God’s peace be with you all.

[Miss Taylor emerges from the Protestant bus line, neatly dressed.]

Miss Taylor: Sister Michael, lovely to see you this morning.

Sister Michael: Miss Taylor, you’re looking well.

Miss Taylor: Thank you. Always a pleasure to greet kind faces before the day begins.

Jenny: (whispering to Aisling) She always smells of lavender, doesn’t she?

Aisling: More like lily-of-the-valley. Lavender makes me sneeze.

Michelle: Who cares, as long as she doesn’t make us do extra homework.

Miss Taylor: How are the girls? Jenny, Aisling, Michelle?

Jenny: Fine, Miss Taylor. Just about ready for another glorious day in holy captivity.

Miss Taylor: (smiling) Well phrased.

Sister Michael: We will teach them not just lessons from books, but lessons of compassion.

Headmistress: A noble endeavour, Sister Michael. Diocese business calls—boys, carry on.

[Protestant boys file off towards their building.]

Sister Michael: Miss Taylor, after school?

Miss Taylor: I should like that very much.

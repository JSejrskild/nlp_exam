[Outside the house. Rita, Erin, Clare, Michelle, Orla are crammed into a car. Music blasts. Everyone excited—except Erin.]

Rita: Are you sure James is going to arrive on time with the tickets?

Erin: He said he’d be here by six. It’s quarter past.

Clare: He promised though. He’s never missed a gig yet.

Michelle: Except that one time when he lost his phone on the bus.

Orla: Yes, but that was different. That phone was practically a brick.

Rita: Well, we can’t just wait here all night. Take That won’t wait for James.

Erin: Maybe we go back. Pick him up.

Clare: What? Drive back through all that traffic just for one lad?

Michelle: Have you seen the queues lately? It’ll add another hour at least.

Orla: But if he doesn’t have the tickets, none of us gets in.

Rita: True. Or someone needs to stay behind. One of us can’t miss out.

Erin: I’ll stay. I can try talking them into letting me in without a ticket.

Clare: You think that’s going to work? With security?

Michelle: I’d volunteer, but I’ve got Mum’s fancy shoes and they’ll be ruined.

Orla: I could stay. I’m already in my trainers.

Rita: No—look, we split. Half go on to the venue. Half stay and fetch James.

Erin: That’s madness. We leave you lot alone? You’ll never make it in time.

Clare: And what if James is driving? We’ll be stuck without him.

Michelle: Unless he phones... Oh wait, battery’s probably dead.

Orla: We could text until the phone dies.

Rita: Decision time. We either go back now or gamble.

Erin: I say we gamble. We can’t lose much.

Clare: We’ll lose the best view, that’s what.

Michelle: And maybe the chance to scream when they hit “Back for Good”.

Orla: Exactly. It’s the chorus. The best chorus.

Rita: Erin, Clare, Michelle—you're sure you want to risk it?

Erin: Yes. Yes, gamble.

Clare: Aye, gamble.

Michelle: Fine by me.

Orla: (sighs) If you lot are going on ahead, I’ll stay behind with Rita to get James.

Rita: Right. We’ll drive off in five. Those going ahead—stay close to the stage.

Erin: Deal. Best of luck, Rita.

Clare: Don’t mess this up, James.

Michelle: We’ll see you at the gate if not inside.

(They share quick smiles. Erin, Clare, Michelle rev engines; Rita and Orla watch as the car pulls away.)

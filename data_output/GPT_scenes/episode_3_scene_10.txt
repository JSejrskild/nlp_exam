[Outside on a farm track. A dead sheep lies on the ground. Rita is perched in the back of a rusty van, sipping a beer. Michelle, Erin, Clare, and James stand nearby.]

Rita: (yells from van) Right! Get that bleedin’ sheep in the trailer! And I want it done before sundown!

Erin: (backs away) No way, Rita. I’m not touchin’ that thing. It’s… it’s horrible.

Clare: Erin, stop being dramatic. It’s just a sheep. Dead, yes, but just a sheep.

Michelle: Erin’s not moving, Rita. We’ll need someone else on it.

James: (gulps) Me? I’m only six, Michelle! I’m too small!

Rita: (shouts) Don’t care how old you are, James. Pick it up. I paid good money for this trailer.

Erin: (to Clare) You do it then. You love animals so much on Instagram, Clare. Put your hands where your mouth is.

Clare: Erin, that’s not fair. I’ll pass on stroking sheep corpses today.

Michelle: Look, everybody’s frozen. James, you'll do it. Two hands under its belly, drag while Clare pushes from the back.

James: (wobbles closer) Alright… but it smells awful. Rita, you ought to see this!

Erin: (nervous, backing further) And if I faint, Rita? What happens then?

Rita: (laughs) Then you wake up, Erin. Now MOVE!

Clare: Come on, James, I’ll help with the pushing. Erin, you can be the spotter — stand behind so you’re not too near the gore.

Erin: (reluctantly steps back) Fine. I’ll be … the spotter. But I’m warning you – if I see even a bit of wool, I might puke.

Michelle: That’s the spirit. Now one… two… three! (James and Clare hoist the sheep)

Rita: (from van, raising her beer) That’s it! Good lads and lassie. Happy now?

James: (panting) Happy? My arms are gonna fall off. But… yeah. Happy enough, Rita.

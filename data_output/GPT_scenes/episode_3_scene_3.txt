[Outside Erin’s house. The gang is gathered at the gate. It’s dusk.]

Erin: Right, is everyone ready? Tickets, phones, shoes—Orla, you got your gum?

Orla: Aye, I’ve got gum. But I’ve still got a bad feeling about that polar bear poster outside the concert hall. It’s huge.

Michelle: It’s only a picture, Orla. Polar bears don’t wander into gigs in Belfast.

James: You never know. Last time I went to a fair, a life-size dinosaur costume chased me.

Clare: Stop exaggerating, James. The polar bear is just part of the light show or something.

Erin: If he moves, I’m legging it. (pauses) But I’m going anyway. Aren’t we all?

Michelle: We are. We’re going. Fear of polar bears won’t stop us. Concert tickets cost money, Erin.

James: My Mum says if I survive the polar bear, I can have ice cream after.

Orla: See? Stakes are high. Very motivational.

Clare: Who’s meeting us at the venue? My Da said he’ll drop me off early.

Erin: I’ll pick you up on the way. Michelle and I are sharing the lift.

Michelle: With James in the backseat, singing half the drive—promise no bears in the back, okay?

James: I’ll behave—unless there’s an impromptu roar.

Orla: Let’s just promise to stick together, aye? If the polar bear show starts, we stay tight.

Erin: Deal. Now let’s go get dressed before the concert starts without us.

Clare: Wait—did anyone bring a jacket? Neon lights are cold.

Michelle: I’ve got Erin’s spare hoodie. Just in case.

Erin: Good—fear of polar bears and cold neon wind, but nothing’s stopping us tonight.

James: To the concert! And to the polar bear—may it stay on the poster.

Orla: (smiling) On the poster, it is. Let’s fly, you lot.

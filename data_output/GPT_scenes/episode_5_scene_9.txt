[At Erin’s kitchen. Erin is pacing; Mary is ironing; Orla is poking at a bowl of porridge.]

Erin: I’m telling you, Mammy, Jenny’s up to something with this prom.

Mary: What do you mean, Erin?

Orla: She means she’s organising it, Mammy. She’s very proud. Like she’s the Queen of the School.

Erin: Exactly. And when Jenny gets proud, she does things behind your back—rigs things.

Mary: Rigging a prom? That’s a serious claim, girl.

Orla: Erin’s new friend—what’s her name again?

Erin: Aoife. She’s from Donegal. She says Jenny asked her to vote for Jenny in the prom royal court.

Orla: The royal court, Erin? Are we back in medieval times?

Erin: Well, that’s how she’s acting. A girl who promised fairness, but there’s whispering in the hallway, promises, bargains…

Mary: And Aoife believes Jenny?

Erin: She does. But I don’t need this drama, Ma. I’d rather skip the whole thing.

Orla: Skip the prom? Erin, your dad paid for the ticket.

Mary: I don’t like the sound of Jenny being sly.

Erin: It’s not just that—last week, Jenny said she was giving out voting papers fairly. Aoife told me she watched Jenny stuff some extra slips in.

Orla: That is sly.

Mary: If that’s true, Jenny should be called out. Has anyone seen this?

Erin: Aoife saw. Claire saw. But everyone’s scared of Jenny’s crowd.

Orla: Why are teenagers always either in a crowd or terrified of one?

Mary: Erin, are you certain you want to skip? Wouldn’t it be easier to expose Jenny at the prom?

Erin: Maybe. But I don’t want to fight. I just want a night that’s real—to dance, to laugh, not whisper behind veils of votes.

Orla: You could use humor—call her bluff in front of everyone.

Erin: I don’t need to be prom queen. I need to be me.

Mary: That’s right. If Jenny wants a crown, let her have it. But I’ll not see my daughter walking into a trap.

[Doorbell rings]

Jenny: (outside, calling) Erin! Erin, are you there?

Erin: (sighs) She’s here.

Jenny: Erin! You coming out?

Erin: (opening door) No, Jenny. I’m not going. And I won’t be part of something rigged.

Jenny: What? You can’t do that—you’ll look weak—

Erin: Better weak than fake. (Closes door and walks away)

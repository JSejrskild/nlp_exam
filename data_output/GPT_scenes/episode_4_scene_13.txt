[In the Quinn house bathroom. Erin, Clare, Orla and Michelle crowded around a clogged toilet. A small bag of pills lay on the floor.]

Erin: For heaven’s sake, someone flush it, quickly!

Clare: Erin, you can’t just chuck the whole lot down—if it’s clogged, we’ll flood the house.

Orla: Erin, where’s the plunger? You know, that red thing we bought.

Erin: I thought I left it by the sink. It’s… it’s not here. I swear, I didn’t take it upstairs.

Michelle: Great. No plunger. And that’s exactly when we need one—now.

Erin: Right, okay. Well, what do we do? We can’t just leave it sitting there, can we?

Clare: Michelle, block the overflow hole. Make sure no water starts coming up.

Michelle: (places hand over overflow's vent) Done. Now what?

Orla: Use the shampoo bottle—pour some soapy water in. Helps lubrication, maybe the blockage will move.

Erin: On it. (She pours shampoo and water into the bowl)

Clare: Is the water level rising?

Michelle: Yes! Erin, stop! It’s halfway up the rim!

Erin: Well, I’m trying something. What about a coat hanger or something rigid to push it through?

Orla: That’s disgusting. But… might work.

Clare: Do you really want us practicing plumbing with a coat hanger? We’ll scratch the porcelain.

Erin: (frustrated) I don’t care! Just push!

Michelle: (takes hanger) Okay… pushing… back and forth… nothing.

Orla: Are you making it worse? Because the water’s getting murkier.

Clare: Erin, open the window at least. Smell is getting bad.

Erin: (opens window) Fresh air—right.

Michelle: We could try boiling water. My mum once cleared a clogged sink that way.

Orla: Toilet, Michelle. Toilet. Boiling water might crack it! Never mind standing here arguing.

Clare: Erin—listen. Maybe the best thing is: leave it. Let gravity do its work overnight.

Erin: And we’re going to sleep with that thing overflowing?

Michelle: No. But we could mop up now, put down towels. When it cools, try again in the morning.

Orla: What about calling someone? Dad? No… Mum?

Erin: Mum will kill us. Dad will lecture us about drugs without asking what they are.

Clare: We just… need time. Let it settle. And tonight, try again.

Michelle: We’ll clean up the mess, stash the bag somewhere safe—just until then.

Erin: Fine. But tomorrow, first thing—new plunger.

Orla: Agreed. And maybe less improvising.

Clare: Right. Let’s clear out. I can’t stay here, I’m getting light-headed.

Erin: Someone grab towels. We’ll mop this swamp up before anyone notices.

[They scramble for towels, grimacing at the mess, as water dribbles dangerously close to the edge.]

[Outside Erin’s house. Erin and Orla are each shoulder-strapping backpacks. Morning light.]

Erin: Are you sure there’s no breakfast first?

Orla: There’s a banana in my bag. Your Ma made the toast.

Erin: Fine. (slings bag) South-east for half a mile, she said. Then wait. More instructions.

Orla: Why south-east though? Why not just go east?

Erin: She’s always fancied compass points. Learned them during the Troubles, she says.

[They step off the porch and begin walking down the lane.]

Mary: (from doorway) Girls! Did you pack enough socks?

Erin: (calling back) Socks are in, Ma! And two bottles of water.

Mary: Good. And stay together. Whatever comes next.

Orla: (quietly) Erin, what if the instructions are stupid?

Erin: We’ll make them less stupid. That’s what we’re good at.

[They round the corner and head along a narrow road toward south-east.]

Orla: I hate marches like this. All this walking and nobody telling you when it's going to end.

Erin: Think of it like a treasure hunt. With imminent danger.

Orla: That’s ___ comforting.

[They walk past a row of closed shops, bags heavy on shoulders.]

Erin: Half a mile isn’t far. Shouldn’t take more than ten minutes.

Orla: And then?

Erin: Then we wait. Maybe messages. Maybe people. Whoever.

Orla: Promise we’ll go home if it gets mad dangerous?

Erin: I promise. Nothing’s worth risking you.

Orla: Thanks. (smiles) Now hurry up—I’m lagging behind.

[They continue walking, fading into the quiet street as the sky lightens.]

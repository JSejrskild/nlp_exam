# NLP exam - LMM's and creativity
## Does LLM's negatively affect the public view of manuscripts for tv'series

**Research Question:**

Does LLM’s generate tv-series scenes that are detectable and/or favoured over human written tv-series scenes. 

This research question will be investigated by giving a LLM the first season and then produce scenes from season two by prompting it with a summary of the scene. 

Hereby the essence will likely be similar (summary) and the correct characters will be used (1st season). To then evaluate the performance of the LLM we will have to set up an experiment where humans will evaluate two scenes at a time for AI-detection and preference. 

This RQ can be used to shine light on the current debate on AI and creativity leading to strikes in hollywood and a new nordic film-making manifesto that also explicitly states that no manuscript can be written by AI or with counsel from AI. 

**How?**

We will download the data and split it into episodes and seasons and scenes

Then we will generate summaries of all scenes in season 2. 

They will be generated using AI, and be equal in terms of length, tone etc. 

We then have a new dataset of human written scenes and AI generated scenes. These will be used in a psychopy experiment where participants will have to read to scenes side by side and write their preference and also which one they believe to be AI generated. Sometimes they will get both questions and sometimes they will only be asked to select their preference.
